tmobile,comment,nnt85wc,2025-11-08 13:15:14,So yesterday an elderly couple came in to my retail store and we had a great conversation. We spoke about everything Tmobile had to offer even though they were already existing customers. They wanted to try our 5g home internet. The husband didn’t have his phone on him and the wife was not an authorized user on the app but was on the account. So we tried to do it through her app but she had no access. We tried to log into his email but being elderly he didn’t know his password and not having his phone we couldn’t do a forgot password. We went through every outlet we could to try and get it done in the t-life app it was just not possible given the circumstances. He wanted it to watch the football games and who was I to turn down a sale after making every attempt. My DM was apparently furious and said we should have sent him away to another store ( which makes no sense ) or to come back tomorrow which they weren’t able to. They are telling me to turn down sales over not using t-life. We the front lines cannot lose money because the app isn’t foolproof. I doubt the company would oblige if they knew what was going on as well. Not sure what to do at this point. Any advice?,1,0.065,0.889,0.046,-0.7056

You'll have to pay all past due, possibly any current charges if you have a current bill that has posted and hasn't hit the due date. If you have any financed equipment, it will be on the current balance if your current bill cycle has closed after cancelation. The chat rep likely couldn't verify you due to the account being canceled, but everything should still be there and waiting to be resumed from cancel.

Go into a store with photo ID (preferably drivers license or state non drivers license), be prepared to pay any remaining past due, but ask that they loop in their retail support line friends to get to the bottom of this (edit: forgot to add RSL will be necessary to resume the account anyway, might as well get them looped in early). If you have a current bill, ask to only pay past due to resume service. If your bill cycle closed and you have financed equipment billed out, ask to have the EIPs reopened rather than having to pay it all off now. Be kind, be patient, it will all be okay.

Check the store locator and see if you can find an Experience Store in your area or at least one listed as ""T-Mobile Store"" rather than ""T-Mobile Authorized Retailer"". I'm not one to hate on TPRs, corporate and Experience stores are just more likely to have the staff to sit with you and RSL to resolve this.

I don't work from home as much as I used to but still do at times. WiFi calling is quite good when it works and bummer yours didn't work out. I don't really like to depend on wifi calling in the event internet goes out. With AT&T, I'd have to depend on wifi calling or go out on the driveway whereas t-mobile and verizon I wouldn't have to. With that said, AT&T fiber has been rock solid and because my discount would go $40/month lower, I may be able to live off of wifi calling and AT&T has a nice feature where my phone can be a backup to the gateway. I tested out T-mobile myself and it's my backup esim right now. It's been really solid with feature parity between Verizon and T-mobile. 

Plus, my wife is perfectly fine and happy with Verizon so there's that too. I tried to get her to test t-mobile with a backup esim but that didn't go so well, so I took it off lol 

I've tested out t-mobile and they are great in my home area but it's been verizon when I travel, while verizon is ehh in the home area, which is why I've been running dual sim for 4-5 years.

Getting good QCI and SA and voice over 5G SA.

So I check up on this forum every now and then to see if they offer it. 

Another downside to essentials is that you cannot get free lines added to your account and if you were to upgrade to the newer plans they would charge you taxes and fees per free line on top of your paid lines too, so I would also check here for free lines. You could add friends or families to your account and charge them (that’s what I do) I charge anywhere from $30-$50 per line depending on how close we are 😂 with the exception of my little siblings, and parents (they get charged $0) also you missed out on the buy 2 lines and get 1 free when you opened up your account which I’m not sure if you can retroactively still add, if anyone can kindly chime in to confirm",1,0.077,0.796,0.127,0.9447

Over the summer, my tower literally blew up. I didn't know except I complained often (once or twice a week). It was down for 2-3 months.

But they were supposedly waiting on parts because the battery backup system blew up, electrical panel melted, etc. The tower was running on a gas generator apparently. And we often joked that the generation ran out of gas because every night, after the tower was working ok (maybe half capacity), it would just stop working again.

Also, I thought any amount TMO would pay as an eip (had to look that one up LOL) would be in the form of a bill credit spread over 24 months- so I'd still have to take the $1100 out of my pocket and just see the $800 in the form of a bill credit, is that right?

>You could still port to TMO open your account at a COR store and get the phone right then and there if they have it in stock and return the VZ phone and pay any fees they may charge.

And this brings me back to the original question.  I would be porting 4 numbers.  One of the numbers shows as ""pending changes"" in my Verizon account, because the upgrade was ordered (almost a month ago) but not processed.  My thought was I would have to release those ""pending changes"" before my number could be ported to TMO.  AND, to release those pending changes I would have to cancel all 4 upgrade orders - which would mean returning the phones.  I have to look into the process to cancel.  round and round I go......

However because the phone is locked and wont be unlocked till either A 60 days of activation or B paid out in full thats where the problem is.

tmobile,comment,nno100b,2025-11-07 15:41:32,"I may have overstated it when putting checks ahead of credit cards, but the reason this topic comes up is until T-Mobile recently announced its own credit card that would allow autopay discounts, the choice was checking information or debit card.  There the choice is clear because debit cards not only can be used at many more places but also have all the risk of temporary loss of a checking account (worse actually).  Without the necessary protection of a signature or proper account transfer authorization.

So yeah, if T-Mobile still did credit card auto pay discounts I'd use a credit card.  I'm not going to get their credit card just to get the discount and avoid giving them my checking account numbers.  If I did get their credit card, paying T-Mobile would be all I used it for and it would sit in a safe.

You can use the routing and account numbers on a check to create counterfeit checks, initiate ACH debits, or set up online payments. That is exactly how a lot of check and ACH fraud is carried out, and regulators and consumer agencies are warning about it.  ￼

Yes, banks often absorb the losses when a fraudster deposits or passes a counterfeit item, and yes banks are careful about account opening. That does not mean the risk is harmless. Victims still face stolen funds, temporary freezes, hours on the phone, disputed transactions, and the paperwork of police reports and disputes. Agencies are asking for public input because check, ACH, and wire fraud have surged in recent years.  ￼

Your point that checks are less risky than a lost credit card is reasonable, but that is precisely why many people prefer credit. Credit cards carry stronger consumer protections, tokenization, and zero liability rules that reduce the real cost and hassle of fraud. For bank account numbers, those protections are weaker, and remediation takes longer. The data show noncard payment fraud has jumped sharply, and regulators are actively looking at fixes.  ￼

Practical alternative, same approach banks take: segregate, monitor, limit exposure. Keep bill payments on an account with minimal balance, use single‑purpose accounts for outgoing payments, use credit cards or ACH via payment processors that do tokenization, and monitor accounts daily.

tmobile,comment,nnnmgbg,2025-11-07 14:25:27,"You probably rely on Zillow for real estate advice too.  That is not written by professionals, well a professional reporter perhaps.  Note real advice has citations to their sources. What I do agree with in that article is the banks take losses--the bank that deals with the fraudulent person, not the bank where the account is held.  And again, that is why banks are so careful about who they let open accounts.

And note I have not said something happening is impossible, only less likely than with a credit card.  Of course they can create counterfeit checks.  And the entity taking the loss will be the entity that dealt with the forger, not the holder of the checking account.

But how in the world do you think you avoid the risk entirely.  Have a checking account and never write a single check or have a single transaction?  And if you're really worried about this you'd never have a checking account at the same bank you have a savings account, because they could wipe out your savings too!

BTW, I am probably the most risk adverse person you'll run into, so for example I don't have debit cards.  But I also never have a checking or savings account at a bank I owe money to (ignoring monthly credit card balance).  And I have accounts at multiple banks and all my bill payments are done from a bank I have relatively little money in beyond what is necesary to not pay fees and to pay the charges (similar to many corporations payroll accounts).

That is just wrong. You can absolutely use the account and routing numbers from a check to create counterfeit checks or initiate unauthorized ACH debits or online payments. Financial authorities and payment networks explicitly warn this is how ACH and check fraud happen.

Check and ACH fraud cost consumers and banks billions every year, so it is not some hypothetical. Recent industry and government reports show fraud losses in the billions and a sharp rise in scams and internet-enabled financial fraud.  

Yes, banks and regulators can often reverse unauthorized debits or recredit accounts, but that does not remove the real harms: stolen funds, hours on the phone, temporary holds, and the headache of police reports and fraud investigations. Nacha and consumer protection agencies still require consumers to report and dispute unauthorized ACHs, because the risk is real.  

Corporations use checks because they have treasury controls, fraud teams, and monitoring systems that individuals do not. That is why businesses can tolerate the risk and individuals often cannot. Saying “it can’t happen” ignores how these schemes actually work and the data showing rising losses.

No they can't, despite the fact a lot of people think that!  You're basing your belief on a false premise.

Now if you purposefully leave a book of checks in an insecure position you might have some liability, but that's about it.

And if the risks of checks were as great as you say, then fraud protection would be terribly expensive.  Corporations have systems in place to monitor checks clearing, and even separate accounts for separate functions.",1,0.195,0.758,0.047,-0.9299

A9 tablet is free with new line.     You have to do your own churn by canceling the existing  tablet lines ($40) ,  hotspot to your phone cell phone for 3  months.  Then after 3 months,  do the A9 promo with new lines.

Or do the A9 promo with new lines now,  after 90 days ,cancel the old tablet lines.  You  will be paying extra $120 ($40 * 3 months)

People can suggest canceling the old tablet lines immediately after activating the new lines.   I would take the former approach to be safe.

The check clearinghouse system is rather secure.  That's why you can give a check to someone relatively safely, and why checks don't have fancy electronic chips and three number codes on the back.  Only relatively a few entities can access that system, whereas anyone who buys a Square payment device can access the debit/credit card payment system.

Also the law is very clear that the entity that deals with the fraudster is the party who takes the loss.  That's why banks are so careful about who they open accounts for.  

But think about your own personal experience.  How many times in your lifetime has a bank sent you a new credit/debit card with a new number on it, or out of sync date expiration change because your credit/debit information has been compromised?

Is there any way to have the lines on different plans on one account? Or would they have to actually be set up by different people? 

E.g. could I have 3 on Essentials and 1 on Beyond?

Or would I need to have one account with the 3 lines and an entirely separate account/bill with the 1 Beyond? (At which point it's probably not worth it.)

My situation is that I have family members that I am an responsible for that really just need the minimum, and I'd like to take advantage of the promotions to get them newer phones since theirs are getting old, but I'm more tech savvy myself and would prefer higher QCI and T-Sat etc.

2. My bill was variable and all over the place due to an error acknowledged on their side. That's how this entire mess started. I was supposed to be paying $80 per month per line. I was getting bills as high as $500 per month for reasons literally no one could define or explain. That's why I called in 2024 to leave them. They offered ""a lower rate plan"" with \*zero\* other explanation as a hail mary.

Most are on regular consumer plans, including me, and cannot comment on restricted business plans. That would be for those on such plans or T-Mo employees.

Also, it's highly unlikely there was no documentation for business plans. Again, check your Account History.

Searching for your plan name.in Google led me to this - https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/t-mobile-unveils-big-moves-to-help-small-businesses-grow

The query likely refers to a T-Mobile business plan promotion that offered a $1,000 credit per line over 36 monthly bill credits for adding at least 10 lines on a ""Business Unlimited Edge"" plan. This was a subsidy-style offer, meaning the credit was applied over time and was dependent on keeping the account active for 36 months. If the account was canceled, the remaining credits would be lost. 
Plan: This offer was tied to the ""Business Unlimited Edge"" plan.
Requirement: New T-Mobile business customers had to add a minimum of 10 lines to qualify.
Credit amount: A $1,000 credit per line was provided.
Disbursement: The credit was given as 36 monthly bill credits.
Terms: The full credit was only received if the account remained active for the entire 36-month period; cancellation would result in the loss of remaining credits. ",1,0.029,0.819,0.152,0.9773

2) Get a bigger piece of the swipe fee pie.

posting this on t-mobile and verizon. 

currently have t-mobile. been with them for about 12 years or so. i got their employee discount from my work (75% off) about 6 years ago. I’m still somehow locked into the 75%. have two lines, netflix (no ads), apple tv and hulu (i ended up doing the $7 extra plan for disney and espn).

about a few months ago, i called to ask about the new plans. i was on the plan that included taxes and fees. i was told with the discount both plans are the same price but i would get more hotspot with the experience more plan. i don’t have cellular on my ipad and often will use my ipad or mac with hotspot. so i switched. the app and website both never showed the pricing with the discounts. 

i started to notice my bill was slightly higher. $5-7 more but the phone rep never told me that taxes and fees will be separate. 

i’ve had issues with my account as well. for some reason i can’t make changes for certain things, app is always buggy, service has been pretty bad lately. i live in So Cal. 

i always hesitated from upgrading because of the discount and the perks t-mobile offers with the free-wifi on some flights, streaming options andthe occasional good deals on Tuesdays. 

now i’m thinking of upgrading to verizon. my work gets 50% off at verizon. if i switch, i get $1100 off new phones. i just bought a new 17 pro but my mom is looking to get a new 17 pro max. so i figured since both lines would get $1100 off a new device, i would just get myself an iPhone Air or a Pixel 10 Pro or Z Flip (basically any device that’s $0). Both lines on the ultimate plan with disney/hulu/espn, netflix/hbo and youtube premium each for $5 (the add ons are also 50% off). 

at t-mobile i’m paying for two lines on experience more, netflix (no ads), hulu and apple tv (both for free) for $69/month. 

verizon id be paying for two phones (17PM for $10/month, Air for $0) on two lines on unlimited ultimate, and the three add ones for $95/month. both phone are without a trade in. 

while i am paying more for verizon, i am getting two new phones. plus they’re currently giving a $200 gift card for accessories or paying my bill. 

is verizon better than t-mobile? does the verizon options sound good with the upgrade i’m getting? or should i keep t-mobile still while i’m getting the 75% off?",1,0.017,0.913,0.07,0.9775

tmobileisp,comment,nnq5j2r,2025-11-08 00:08:06,"I have the new G5AR TMHI gateway, I had a single 4x4 waveform antenna on the old G4SE. I went ahead and hooked up the 4x4 on the G5AR, I think it is about par or worse than early tests on the standalone gateway. I did see one increase and that was with the upload speeds, going from 10-12 to as much as 70, far faster than my download speeds. Our internet isn't very fast here even with the antenna outside, ranging around 20-40 most days, occasional bursts to 100, but never sustained.

My question(s): When the 4x4 is hooked to the TMo gateway, does it actually disable the other  ""antenna"" inside the gateway, if I am wording that right. And, if I unhook the 4x4 antenna I have installed, will I damage the gateway if I power it on without the external antenna, since that is now the antenna and many things will fry if powered on without their antennas on.

Pricewise, a standalone 5G router like a Chester cheetah or a nvisaGig, etc, is not a lot more than another antenna, but brings other benefits to the table. Would I be ahead to get the router and hook up the single 4x4 I have to it, rather than getting another 4x4 and hooking it to the TMo gateway? 

Or, 3rd option, could a smaller quad mini in the window be added to make it 8x8, instead of another big outdoor antenna, to save on space and cost? Or is that a mismatch that would cause an issue?

New to this stuff and trying to learn, but be budget conscious too.

Ours was also placed in a back room of the house, but we were only given the single Eero router instead of a mesh system like was advertised. Our speeds are 16mpbs down and 7 up on the other side of the house.  Very disappointing.  We had a Google mesh system set up previously off our Xfinity router, which was centrally located in the house and speeds were consistent around the home at 150 mbps.  We set that up with the TFiber just to see if we could get better speed and are seeing varying speeds around the home. The opposite end is 90-100 mbps and 150 right next to the Eero.  Speeds without the mesh next to the Eero are 900mbps.  We are on the 2gig plan.

  The fiber install was scheduled for 8am. They showed up right at 8 and ran a new fiber cable hanging from the pole to the house.
(depending on the area it's ran underground)
They removed all old fiber boxes and hardware and mounted a new box on the exterior of my home. 
I had existing stuff for fiber in my home so they reused entry points but all new wires. 
They offered to run a cable where I want if needed so that's an option...
 (As a previous telecommunications installer I know that after a certain distance they charge for cable, but talk to the tech to verify) 
They did have to do work at the fiber head so it took longer to activate than to actually install.
 I have the eero home mesh system and it works seamless with T-Mobile fiber modem an getting the speeds promised! 
The install took 6 hours for me which was the only downside for me. 
Service has been great so far with no complaints!

For example if Verizon advertises ""up to 300 Mbps"" and you can be damn sure you'll stay under 300 Mbps no matter what - that's done by throttling. Same with video streaming, they claim no throttling, but if its on a service that doesn't play ball with them, the speeds are absolutely capped at 480p like in this case. They do this by identifying video streams and limiting their data rate for them (which forces your browser and/or the video service to lower the resolution).

Then a door-to-door rep came to my house promising a $70 locked in price for 10yrs with a trenched in line. I was sold. Had T-Fiber service for a month and a half and switched back.

Also for a more realistic latency possibly try a server set on Ookla outside the T-Mobile network. Something close to you PoP. I get the same thing when running Ookla on the PC for latency when going to a T-Mobile server, then outside about 40ms, then real world via a ping about 80ms.

tmobileisp,comment,nn3m7ii,2025-11-04 12:41:56,"I am using the G4AR and recently bought the mesh extender to try it out.

Unfortunately, the T-Mobile mesh node will create a 40mhz bandwidth 2.4ghz channel. This overlaps with other 2.4ghz channels in my home so I don't use it. Setting the 2.4ghz channel to 20mhz in Hint does not affect the node and T-Life doesn't let you customize that either. Sometimes, if I reboot the node, it will create a 20mhz channel, but it seems totally random.

You also cannot choose the channel that the node uses and mine uses the same 5ghz, and sometimes 2.4ghz, channel as the main gateway, often, even though I have the node connected with ethernet. It would be better if it used a different, non-overlapping channel. Sometimes, if I reboot the node, it will create a 20mhz 2.4ghz non-overlapping channel and a non-overlapping 5ghz channel, but it seems totally random.

I also have Starlink, so I need the ability to limit the channel bandwidth of the 2.4ghz signal and be able to select the channel of the node. With the proper mesh node, I would have three 2.4ghz non-overlapping channels, and three 5ghz, non-overlapping channels. The T-Mobile node doesn't allow me to do that reliably.

I would suggest getting a system that lets you fine tune the bandwidth and channel of the wireless signals.",2,0.016,0.921,0.063,0.8765

tmobileisp,comment,nmu1h96,2025-11-02 23:26:20,">Resetting the gateway to factory default settings, which we could not do fully

 a hard reset is usually done by pressing a pin/thumbtack/sim tool/paperclip into a reset hole on your modem. if that's what you tried, try again 2 more times. IMO a 20 minute reset is abnormal, ~5 minutes would be normal. 

IMO hardwire one of ur laptops to again test for internet. 

if still no internet IMO seek a replacement modem (they are free).   

looks like u have an older modem. if your modem still doesn't fully reset and/or you still don't have internet on multiple devices tell T-Mobile about your hard reset troubleshooting attempts, tell them TMHI is not working for you anymore and u WANT a replacement modem.

if the TMo support u r using isn't cooperative take your modem to a local T-Mobile  store (CORPORATE store only NOT an ""T-Mobile authorized retailer"") and swap modems. the new modems are white. 

if a CORPORATE TMo store isn't available seek support from T-Mobile's Social Media Care Team, also known as T-Force,  **available only through Facebook or Twitter**. T-Force is better support.

Basically, humanity ran out of IPv4 addresses to assign individual customers. As a result, ISPs are resorting to CG-NAT as a tool to deal with the lack of IPv4 addresses. CG-NAT won't allow peer to peer connections to work. This is why you can't hold a connection to your portal (if you're trying to remote play your PlayStation from away from home) and why some games simply won't work online. 

I don't know exactly how to fix your portal connection but I did by installing tailscale on my GL.iNet router which puts everything on my network on Tailscale (otherwise each device needs the app). I then installed Tailscale on my Android phone and connect the 2 when I want to remote play. The portal doesn't have a Tailscale app, so that wouldn't be a solution for you. You might be able to use your phone's hotspot after the phone connects to Tailscale but I'm not sure if it'll carry over to the hotspot. Also, Tailscale can add more latency. 

For the online games - you need a VPN. Basically, some other kind of connection that isn't behind CG-NAT.",1,0.042,0.912,0.046,0.2299

If so, not only do you have the signal metrics to dial in gateway/antenna aiming, but all the info you need to not only derive which tower you are currently connected to, but also which specific cell/radios on that tower you are connected to. That is helpful information to pay attention to when you have big fluctuations. 

Even if your gateway is not jumping to a different tower or even different bands, that doesn't mean it's not jumping to a different cell on that tower. There are usually many on a tower, even for the same respective bands, with each meant to service a particular slice of the pie surrounding that tower. For example with 2 people connected to the same tower using the same bands, person A west of that tower likely will be using different cells than person B north of that tower. The cell you normally use could go down or whatever, but other cells on that tower may still keep trucking along fine...but for you, maybe it's picking up a different cell on that same tower not tuned for optimal signal in the slice you are located in or are picking up a different tower all together meaning your metrics and performance may or may not go in the toilet. Knowing which actual cell you are connected to not just when things get flakey, but when they are good too, helps to clue you in on what may actually be going on. 

As for tower work goes, it def can take awhile to be fully ironed out. For example here (coincidentally I'm in the Houston area too near the coast), they totally rebuilt the tower I use earlier this year, complete with new identifiers and everything. It took several weeks of sometimes good, sometimes down, often kicked over to a tower across town, etc before things really got back to somewhat normal. Thankfully the amount of time I was straight down or had extremely poor performance was very limited, but there was a lot of jumping around cells and towers during that time, with performance often being JUST usable. I say somewhat normal as even on the new cells, there were still pretty frequent short outages getting kicked over to other cells/tower for a week or few following that. Maybe just growing pains or them dialing in the output of the cells or something. When that died down it's been pretty rock solid since....so yeah, apparently that stuff CAN take that long. I also drive past that tower all the time and could see the construction/physical phase of the work going on too. So you can't really count that out just because it's been a bit.",1,0.04,0.881,0.079,0.9598

You can purchase your own gateway on Tmo as far as I know. They're just much more expensive devices than your average cable modem. While I still run the Tmo gateway, I run my own router behind it so I can have an easy Wireguard endpoint and firewall that I control.

There are ways to work with CGNAT or whatever happens to be in your way for accessing your NAS. They may be a little more intensive to setup however. Not ideal for some scenarios, but if all you need to do is access your files from anywhere, there are certainly options out there that are reliable and decently performant over Tmo/5g.

Generally you will have a more performant connection w/cable though. I think the regular upload on Comcast plans is 30mbps, so unless you pay for some of the upgraded/business/etc plans then Tmo often can outperform in a key way that would be relevant to your needs.

The link above tests your network speed, latency, and latency under load. It's likely the latency under load that's hurting this. This is caused by buffer bloat, which is explained in the FAQs below. 

There are a couple of things going on. First, most ISP gateways have no built-in traffic management tools, but many networks are fast enough where it doesn't matter. Cellular is typically high latency to begin with, but typically fine for less demanding tasks. 

Using traffic shaping tools in some routers can help. One of the most recommended tools is setting up SQM on a router that supports it. It's not a guarantee it'll help, but it should if you're getting 600 Mbps. But this means buying a router to connect to T-Mobile's gateway, configuring that router, then connecting to the router's wifi instead of the T-Mobile gateway wifi (or router's ethernet). Also keep in mind these traffic shaping tools can reduce download speeds, but reduce latency as a result.",4,0.048,0.866,0.085,0.8627
tmobileisp,comment,nm7afzb,2025-10-30 09:57:25,"Good installers do have tools to check for buried lines where they're digging but they're not always perfect. Installers will send info out ahead of time plus someone will come out to mark major utilities like your municipal water supply. When you noticed those flags and spray paint all over your yard; that would've been the time to mark where your RO runoff line was, yourself. If *you* didn't know where it was; then it makes this complaint all the more bizarre. How is an installer supposed to know where a line is that even a homeowner doesn't know? I buried a hose for a water feature and when my yard was all marked up for the fiber install in my neighborhood; I took some blue spray paint and spray painted a dashed line where my water line was. They were working nowhere near it but it took all of 90 seconds to mark and it assured that they wouldn't cut it.

The fact is, this happens. With any sort of construction or install. Sometimes things get damaged.

And then they make a plan to repair it. No big deal. No; they don't drop everything and repair it right now; nor do you want them to. A fiber installer could probably fix that water line; but wouldn't you rather a plumber do it? So that's what they're doing, finding someone who knows what they're doing to come out and fix it.

The fiber installers in my neighborhood sliced right through both the cable and DSL lines a couple weeks ago. The best part was you could even see where they trenched *right through* the flagged and spray-painted marks by those utilities. I joked with one of my neighbors that this was a pretty sneaky way to get business-- take everyone offline! Ha! Now *that* is a bad installer. But even that was fixed, it happens. People make mistakes. And no, they don't go door to door and ask each and every person exactly where they'd like their line run. It would never get done. And often where they run the line is decided by engineers, not the installer; and often has to do with where utility easements are. In fact one of the issues with your water line here is that it's possible whoever installed it did a poor job; and ran that drain line right through a utility easement. Which means they got lucky and didn't hit anything themselves but if they'd called the number maybe wouldn't have dug through there *at all*. And probably should've routed that line elsewhere.

Fiber also doesn't need to be buried deep. It doesn't freeze or anything like that. You're sort of contradicting yourself here because burying the fiber conduit deeper would be even more destructive to your yard.

It's possible, maybe just possible; that among the things you are an expert in; installation of fiber or other utilities isn't one of them. And it's possible, maybe just possible, that you sometimes make mistakes at work that cause headaches for other people. And it's possible, maybe just possible, that the best course of action is to let them fix it and understand that things happen and ultimately this is not even remotely a big deal. That damage to that drain line doesn't even impact the functionality of your RO system. Literally nothing has happened except a mess was made that they're going to fix.",1,0.089,0.836,0.076,-0.8539

Yes, eCGI, CID and nARFCN are some of the numbers to help determine when using the G5AR, for now it doesn't give the BW of connected band. So for the G5AR, if it is important to somebody to know what BW, using a few sources mentioned may be the only way.

I have submitted a request to the author of HINT Control to see if the next time he works on the app if the API will let him add any of the functionality of the prior gateways.

tmobileisp,comment,nm5u87n,2025-10-30 04:22:36,"You are basically doing the right thing, not much to add as far as what I experienced with this gateway.

Even the smallest rotation when you find a ""good"" spot for the gateway can cause changes. I notice even rotating 5 degrees will cause the gateway to latch on to a different channel of n41. It will go from the 90mhz channel to the 100mhz channel and see slightly better upload. It may start off on one channel (90mhz) then after a period of time it will switch over(100mhz). Possibly use HINT Control, cellmapper and your phone to determine just which channel of n41 it is on at any given moment. The G5AR doesn't show bandwidth like the other gateways in HINT Control, but it can be figured out. Also on that rotation of the gateway it helps at my location to not point it directly at the tower, just a very slight off-set.

Even a difference of a foot or two can change things, for me just the opposite. If I get too high in the window the signal metrics will drop and in turn the speeds/latency/connection consistency will also drop. It is just that important to test every single square inch of your home. Being reasonable after you have found the ""good"" spot.

At some point you are going to have to compromise, speed vs consistency. I can put my G5AR in another spot and get even higher speeds out in the garage, but that location isn't convenient. I don't have ethernet pulled out to the garage yet, so no way to connect the gateway to my mesh system. It could also be just the way the network is built out sort of to say. Maybe that is all the gateway can get from the network and most any spot in your home.

Time, effort and willingness is all there is when it comes to finding your ""good"" spot for the gateway. I have had this service for four years and still tinker with placement.",2,0.03,0.915,0.055,0.8422

tmobileisp,comment,nm0h0mb,2025-10-29 09:21:50,"Consumer Guide to Resolving Telecommunications Billing Disputes

If standard customer service channels (611, store representatives, etc.) fail to resolve significant issues such as incorrect billing, unauthorized charges, or lost equipment returns, consumers have a highly effective method for escalation: filing a formal complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).(Online)

The Recommended Escalation Method: FCC Complaint
Filing an formal complaint with the FCC is often the most direct path to resolution, as it forces a response from a corporate-level representative.(

1. File the Complaint Online
Action: Go directly to the FCC's Consumer Complaint Center (found at fcc.gov/complaints).  
Documentation: Provide detailed evidence, including tracking numbers for returned devices, dates of failed customer service attempts, and copies of incorrect bills.

2. The Required Corporate Response
FCC Mandate: Upon receiving a complaint about a billing or service issue, the FCC serves the complaint on the provider (e.g., T-Mobile).  

Timeline: The provider is required by regulation to respond to both the consumer and the FCC in writing within 30 days.  
Impact: This process bypasses the common ""disconnect"" in front-line customer service and triggers a response from a specialized Corporate Resolution Team or high-level representative.

3. Expected Resolution

Based on successful case precedents, if the consumer's claim is accurate and well-documented (e.g., proof of device return, winning multiple prior cases), the corporate representative is highly likely to reach out and actively work to fully resolve the issue, often resulting in refunds or corrections.
This method transforms an individual customer service dispute into a regulatory matter, ensuring the issue is prioritized and escalated beyond typical support channels.",1,0.106,0.787,0.107,0.1153

Therefore while not as good, still very much worth using. It all really just depends on price/other options and what suits your needs. 

Biggest tip id say is find the right spot to place your gateway. Simply plopping it down and quick aim to the tower following the app might be leaving a lot on the table. Try different places, different rooms, high vs low, even inches can matter. Pay attention to the signal metrics as you change positions. I probably spent 2 or 3 weeks of trial and error/moving it around before settling on its permanent spot.

Is that when the vessel is moving within the slip? If so you can see how everything is wavering for metrics. Also the internal directional antenna is active, it is a kind of beam forming of the signal to and from the connected tower. That can cause a problem if the gateway is moving all around.


The metrics aren't the end all be all, but rssi is sorta bad that is all signals hitting the gateway. Rsrp isn't wonderful either.


As you said speed isn't everything, I also prefer a stable connection over absolute speed.


Set the gateway on a pile on the dock and see if that wavering continues.",2,0.11,0.851,0.038,-0.8275
