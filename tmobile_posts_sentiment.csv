I was told I’d have a hotspot on unlimited $30 plan and it was a lie. So today November 8th I have finally gotten the extra cash to go back to Tmobile and get my old hotspot plan back.

I was told by the Tmobile store I went to today that if I called customer service they would reimburse me for cost of activation fee and SIM card by putting credits on my account for my next months phone bill.

I had to pay $10 activation fee and $10 for a new SIM card. I was told my old Tmobile sim which I brought was invalid.

So I call the customer service and the lady tells me they can’t do this. I asked to speak with a manager and she tells me manager is busy and would call me back.

I’m still waiting.

What can I do? I’ve been with Tmobile since 2013 and only left because they wouldn’t give me a cheaper phone plan and the Metro store said their $30 unlimited plan was exactly the same as Tmobile $50 prepaid.

I’m so angry right now. Boost and Verizon said I couldn’t keep my same number that’s the only reason I came back to this company and to be treated this way.

Fast forward to a week ago when I wanted to buy a phone to actually use the line. I noticed that it wasn't showing under my account. I reached out to Tforce, and apparently there was an activation error on their end, which no one made me aware of, so now I have no free line. 

Since the promotion is gone, they said there's no way for them to fix it, so they offered me six months of free service if I add a line. I asked to speak to a supervisor, but was told that they were aware of their mistake, and that was the best they could do. 

I ended up complaining on the survey they sent me, so I got an email from someone. While deciding what to do, they called me and offered me an additional year of free service for the line, bringing it to 18 months. I appreciate it, but that doesn't come close to the savings of a free line! 

So should I try pushing this further? I know it was a free line and didn't cost me anything, but it was their mistake and I feel like they should give me what I was promised.

When I first checked with a T-mobile store and was given a promo for $1000 off each phone without trade-in and some deals on watches too. (Can’t remember but I think it was BoG $300off 2nd watch).  There was no mention about a down payment or anything limiting the financing.

I heard about the cash & Visa cards at Costco so I went there to check.  Just about the first thing I heard was that there’s a $3600 limit for financing so I would have to make a down payment.(?)  However I assured I would still get the full thousand dollar credit for each of the phone lines.  

This is where I am confused.  If I can only finance $3600 and credits stop once things are paid off, how do I get the full $4000?

I went through the signup process and on the checkout page, the ""Accept & Continue"" button is greyed out.

It's greyed out because there are three buttons at the bottom, all of which must be checked. And the middle one says:

""By checking this box, I agree that T-Mobile, or others acting on its behalf, may call or text me at the number provided above to receive updates and offers, and that they may use an autodialer, artificial voices, or pre-recordings to do so. I understand that my consent is not a condition of purchasing any goods or services, and that I may revoke it at any time.""

I don't want that. And it specifically says consent is not a condition of purchase. But the form won't submit unless it's checked, so it sure seems like it is.

I also found that the iPad and smartwatch plans were automatically put on the most expensive plan in the cart, with no way to change or edit that. It also limited me to switching 5 lines, though that's a much smaller problem. (Depending on what Verizon does when the main phone on the account gets switched away and the only devices left are two iPads and a watch.)

So I wanted to ask if there was a way to fix that and sign up without consenting to robocalls.

When I tried to use the online customer service, the person said he could not help me unless I filled out a form first. The form asked for a lot of personal information and had several additional tabs one of which made it look like it was going to ask for ID.

...and the form had a link to a privacy policy saying the information collected would be used and sold for marketing purposes.

I know all these companies all sell data right and left, but that felt excessive & intrusive just to ask a couple of questions, so I bailed at that point.

Is there, in fact, any way to sign up for service without consenting to robocalls, preferably while also obtaining the $10/mo plans for tablets and watches?

ETA:  One of the upgraded phones is still within the 30 return window.   I don't mind eating some restocking fees, but the $1,100 (17 pro) cost of the phone, if I decide to keep it  gives me pause.

Option 1:  Keep the new phone and bring to TMO.  This involves paying 100% of the phone cost (as it was a ""free"" trade-in) .

Option 2:  Return the new phone within the 30 day window.  Issue here is then this line will not have a phone for however long it takes Verizon to accept and process the returns on my account, because I returned the OG phone as a trade-in and zero chance of getting it back, it's already been processed, too.",0,20,0.046,0.884,0.07,0.8266

I currently have a pair of (32gb) Galaxy Tab A7+ on my account that are quite old and slowing down. They’re used by my kids for streaming video and learning apps like ABC Mouse, plus they like to take pictures with them which absolutely fill the onboard memory.

We are currently on the Go5GPlus plan and are locked in for another 11 months due to our phone promotions. 

I stopped by a local authorized retailer who said they have Galaxy Tab A9+5G available, but there’s no upgrade promotions - only for new lines.

QUESTIONS

— Is it true you now have to avoid any line removals for six months instead of three months to keep a new line promo?
— She suggested moving the insurance to the new tablets since the old ones won’t be in use anymore, and then she could put the old tablets on a lower plan, doing that would result in our bill only going up about seven dollars a month until the old tablets are removed, then our bill would actually drop lower than where it is now.
(she told me this, she did not show me anything on paper)
— I don’t see any tablet plan options for the new ones that would save money compared to our current plans, how can our bill end up going lower?

2. Fast forward to today. I needed new phones. I was eligible. I went to the store to pick them up. IT TOOK THREE HOURS for them to do the account research and let me know that the ""lower rate plan"" was a multi year lock in. With no Equipment Financing.
3. T-Mobile wants to charge me $700 per line to switch my plan even if I stay with TMobile. In order to get device financing. And they have stated I'm completely locked into my current contract.
4. I was so livid. The people in the store and on the phone did their best. Everyone acknowledged that this is bullshit and they don't understand how this exists.
5. I am 100000% done with T-Mobile. I have been a customer for over a decade. They've gotten unreasonably bad. I am leaving no matter what.

\- Do you know of anyone else like ATT/Verizon buying out contracts?

I walked into a fully staffed T-Mobile store today, at least 7 or 8 Mobile Experts were working when I arrived. It was busy, so I got in line and waited patiently. After about 30 minutes, I noticed every ME would disappear into the back office after finishing with their customer and not come back out. We went from eight people on the floor to just one. That’s not only unprofessional, it’s a policy and safety violation, there are supposed to be at least two employees on the floor at all times.

When my name was finally called an hour later for a simple trade-in and phone case pickup, the ME helping me also went into the back mid-transaction. I eventually told the only person left out front, “I have to go to work,” and she replied, “Oh well, he had to print a label, but I don’t know what that has to do with you.” So, I walked out.

Later, I called T-Mobile support to cancel the order for the case I’d placed in the T-Life app, only to learn the store fulfilled the order after I’d left. Not to me. My phone is still sitting here without a case, and I made sure the order was still pending before I walked out. That means it was fulfilled while I was gone, without my ID present. That’s fraud.

The phone was shipped to me with a pre addressed shipping envelope to send the phone back. Thinking nothing of it I put the phone into the envelope and went to the post office to ship it out. Turns out the package was a UPS shipping envelope, but I dropped it off at USPS. 

Unfortunately, at the time I dropped it off it was extremely busy at the post office and I didn't have time to wait around. I left it in the outgoing mail. After about a week I kept getting notices that T Mobile didn't receive my phone. I realized the mistake I had made.

I went to the USPS branch and they assured me that it would still get to where it needed to go, it might just take some extra time. Fast forward 3 months later and T Mobile still has not received it. Unfortunately I did not take down the tracking number, and stupidly enough T Mobile doesn't have the tracking info either.

Knowing it was a long shot, I decided to check with USPS again. They explained that they get a UPS package at least once a day. It gets sent downtown, and the UPS carrier gets it there. Other than that she really couldn't help me, which is understandable.

All of this to say, if you're doing a trade in, just drop it off at a T Mobile store and make sure you get a receipt that they received it.

To keep those specific free line promotions, you must purchase the device outright! ",27,54,0.023,0.835,0.141,0.9501

tmobile,post,1opuywn,2025-11-06 04:01:15,"Why Free T-Satellite 911 Requires An eSIM Download I've been asked this in a ton of DMs and I'm just posting it here because yes, I know about it, and I'm not copy-pasting to 55 people. No, I don't post a lot today. I'm busy, sorry.

T-Mobile is the one carrier left that accepts any device regardless of IMEI.

Which normally is a GOOD THING THAT MAKES THEM A LOT OF MONEY.

**Seriously, I have to stop there, and make clear, the other two carriers screwed this up horribly. So many people in the handset and IoT fleet world turned to T-Mobile because:**

**\* T-Mobile doesn't gatekeep by IMEI.**  
**\* T-Mobile doesn't require a useless VoLTE private key.**  
**\* T-Mobile doesn't suspend your line for SIM swapping into a device they feel is incompatible.... because, it often $#$!$#! isn't.**

Sigh, if you work in Seattle, read all of this in bold clearly. **Do not screw it all up in January. You will lose customers, I promise, because they'll be free agents again.**

In this one edge case, temporarily, it's a problem. You don't want devices that can't use T-Satellite clinging to a T-Satellite tower, especially when trying to call/text 911.

Starlink Mobile is not strong enough yet to handle every handset (literally, ever handset) that is without service with VoLTE for 911 voice calling. They tried. That was part of the beta load testing.

And the FCC requires that to ""take all comers"" - though they can deny devices that don't work from text-to-911. And devices that can use T-Satellite will/should toast the user to text 911 if on a T-Satellite signal.

This is the compromise. Network blocks everyone unless they opt-in, and confirm the device is compatible. The eSIM vets the IMEI and confirms the device can use T-Satellite properly. pSIMs with the feature code vet by IMEI. If an incompatible IMEI falls on the account, the T-Satellite SOC falls off.

Unfortunately, this means if you have the grandfathered discounted T-Satellite, you can't move your SIM around, except to whitelisted IMEIs that support T-Satellite. It may (I stress, may) fall off now this regime is in place.

*And yes nerds, T-Satellite will work with AOSP too. They thought of that for LineageOS and GrapheneOS. All the sat-to-cell tech was put into AOSP, though Messenger was removed. Hence you may need to Install Google Play Services and Google Messenger for full functionality, at least Google isn't blocking that... yet.*",2,10,0.07,0.835,0.095,0.902

I was with T-Mobile for years (previously a Sprint customer), but switched to Mint last year. The phone I had with T-Mobile was a warranty replacement iPhone 14 Pro Max. The device was fully paid off and was unlocked before switching to Mint.

A year later, I got a new phone and reset/erased the 14 Pro Max. After doing so, the phone was SIM locked again. I've been in contact with T-Mobile for almost a month now, and I keep getting the runaround. I've heard several things:

1. I need to go to the store to get the phone unlocked (this was shared with me via Chat agent, and was disputed by several call center reps)
2. There was an unpaid balance on my old account (this was confirmed paid off)
3. Because it was a warranty phone, the system is confusing its IMEI

No matter what I've heard from these reps, they've told me three or four times that my request to unlock the device has been escalated/expedited and to check back in 72 hours. Each time, that window passes and it remains locked. I've been told they would email me a confirmation, but emails never come. I've been told they would text me confirmation, but texts never come.

I've been hung up on while on hold. I've been ""transferred to supervisors"", only to turn out I was transferred to another low-level rep.

**Can anyone provide some insight on this? Has anyone had a similar situation?**

It just strikes me as odd that my previously unlocked and paid-off device was re-locked almost a year after switching carriers and resetting the device. Even weirder that I cannot get a straight answer out of customer service.

***Edit/Update: I finally spoke with a supervisor, who gave me a 4-digit ""MDU (Mobile Device Unlock) Escalation ID"" and said he would call me back Saturday morning with an update if the device wasn't unlocked within 72 hours. He said past requests didn't include mention of the phone's warranty replacement status and asked if I'd received an MDU ID or return calls from prior representatives, and when I said ""no"", he seemed disappointed and said standard process was to call back and provide ""case numbers.""***

I was offered a trade in promo on chat which is the reason I ordered a new phone with that rep. Turned out the rep was wrong. When I checked my account an incorrect worse promo was there instead. T-Force said they would fix it, but they kept replacing it with the same worse promo. After this third chat I now have no promo at all. Rep is telling me it’ll take 1-2 billing cycles for the correct one to show up, but my other promo I got recently was visible on my account within a few days of purchasing (in T-Life view promotions section) so I’m confused why it would take so long. 

The problem is I still have my trade in phone and the app isn’t asking me to send it in anymore since the promo is missing. I am approaching 1 month with new phone. I don’t want to trade in the old one to find out I didn’t get full value, I would rather keep it at that point. What should I do?

Now it’s been more than 14 days (more than 30 days even) since activation, and I’m wondering if I can still qualify for that promo if I order the phone now.

Basically:

* Does the promo start date just need to be before my line was opened, even if I buy the phone later?
* Or does the device purchase have to happen within a certain window (like 14 days) from when I activated the line?

tmobile,post,1oogz5y,2025-11-04 13:37:12,"Employees:  Are upgrades really such a pain? I just came back from the worst store experience of my life trying to upgrade a phone.

It was obvious I was interrupting an important chat among emloyees when I arrived, but the rushed atmosphere throughout the experience really was a turnoff.

Are customers really that much of an annoyance to you?  I know he kept checking his phone and chatting while I was trying to complete the transaction and I know that he did not want to be a part of this activity, but is it really that painful to help a customer upgrade a phone to a new model?  I know that in recent years, employees have not been thrilled when I say I would like to upgrade a phone.

I am not an entitled person.  I know people have other aspects of their life, but these guys had nothing else to do except chat with one another and check their phone messages.  Is doing an upgrade that much of a bother?  It is not like they had a profitiable transaction I was taking them away from.

Just wondering.

NOTE 1:  ADDED:

Apparently most of the people replying do not understand what I have been asking.

I am talking about going into the store to order the upgrade.  Not because I am old and stupid (even though that is likely true).  Not because I am fat and lazy (despite that fact). Not because I am technically illiterate.  Just because T-Mobile partners with the warehouse stores at their corporate kiosks therein to offer an incentive to order it there.

More than half the responses talk about passwords (which have nothing to do with the question) and even more talk about a second trip to the store, which I have not had to do in the past three upgrades.

At T-Mobile, all you need is the account PIN (which I know) to do an upgrade order.

There are no other passwords needed.

The phone gets delivered to my house.

I transfer the data and apps and call 611 if there are any activation issues.

If I have a micro SD card in it, I remove it.

If I have to return the old phone, I reset it to remove any data and delete it from FindMyPhone and then box the old phone and put the sticker on it and drop it off at the carrier.  Then I fight with T-Mobile over the phone for the next month when they claim I never returned it or sent it to the wrong address.  Seriously, if the money for the old phone is relatively small, I won't even accept it since returning it frequently takes hours of phone calls and emails.

If I did not accept any incentive for returning the old phone, I put it on a charger and use it as a clock somewhere.

This is how the last three upgrades I did worked.  Similarly with four of the other upgrades other users on the account did.  

Unless someone can identify an incentive for going to the store a second time, I do not see how the second trip and password comments are even relevant.  Likewise the comments about picking the phone up at the store.  There is absolutely no reason for me to have the phone delivered there unless I am concerned about porch bandits and even for that, I can deal with the carrier to pick up the product at a more convenient location.  For this question, the store/kiosk is not even involved after the order is placed.

NOTE 2 ADDED:

TLDR:  Summarizing the responses:

I am a lazy stupid entitled boomer ahole who should just die to make the world a better place

If I want to do right by employees, the best steps would be:

* Avoid busy times when they are missing potential new customers
* Cancel Protection 360 at least a month prior to upgrading
* Add Protection 360 back when upgrading
* Buy at least 3 additional accessories at the time of the upgrade",43,179,0.11,0.848,0.043,-0.9934

I have been a T-Mobile customer for a long time. I have 4 lines with 2 of them having Jump On Demand. I have seen that Jump On Demand is ending on Dec. 1st and I want to try to get the most value I can out of this.

The notice that jod is ending specified that current jod customers are still eligible for one last upgrade. I've checked in-store, and my two options would be base S25 and base iPhone 17. Here's my situation, I am on my last payment on my current jod leases, meaning if I don't do anything by the 7th of November, I keep my current phones and just pay the remaining purchase price. ~$150. But if I do upgrade, I would pay a down payment on a new phone, and then have the remaining loan balance wiped after Dec. 1st per the T-Mobile notice. Essentially walking away with a new phone for around $400. Am I reading this right? There was some confusion between me and the store manager on how to interpret that. He said "" I don't think T mobile is going to be ok with you making one payment and wiping the rest"" so I reached out to T force to confirm and they have.

My second question of this all is how can i complete my last upgrade, and also keep my current phones? In the past I've been able to do the jod upgrade and take my *old"" phone home, and then the remaining purchase price is added to my next bill which I am 100% ok with. I think they call this a ""deferred payment"" or something but I always have a hard time purchasing the phone at the end because most stores want it back to complete the upgrade, but the phone is almost paid off and I could really use it in one of my other lines.

The person on the phone said that when my billing cycle is over, the ipad line will automatically be canceled and I won't be charged anymore. However he also said he couldn't cancel the ipad line and I just have to wait for the billing cycle to end. 

I did some more research online and I'm not sure if that's the case? People in an older thread said that if the ipad line is not canceled, tmobile will continue to bill me. 

Has anyone else dealt with this before and have some advice? Thank you! ",1,12,0.029,0.923,0.048,0.7102

* Cellular data works fine for *almost* everything
* The only thing that doesn't work is anything where Siri needs to access the Internet (e.g., to get directions somewhere based on a spoken request).
* Siri works fine on WiFi
* Siri also works fine when her phone is tethered to mine, which is also on T-Mobile
* The issue started earlier this year, right after she got home from a trip abroad where she had a 30-day International Data Pass
* Data roaming was on while she was away, but is off now
* We have tried various levels of reset on her phone, including resetting Network Settings, turning Siri off and on again, logging out of iCloud and back in, and even a full reset of the phone (which included a restore from backup, so it's not a full start-from-scratch with all settings, but starting completely over with her data gone is a non-starter).

She's been to the Apple Store. They told her they can't help her because the issue is specific to cellular data. They said it's not the first time they've seen an issue like this occur right after someone gets back from a trip abroad where they'd been using roaming data.

T-Mobile phone support doesn't seem to think it can possibly be the cellular network, and suggested that if a full reset of the phone didn't fix it, then her phone is the problem and she should get a new one. Which is ridiculous. She did say she tried to “reset the phone” remotely and told me to turn it off and on again, but I don't know exactly what that means.

I had full bars available and LTE option. I would try on/off, airplane mode on/off, and making sure my phone was up to date. Nothing. No service.

He recommended that I upgrade my phone (formerly an iPhone 11). I’m familiar with phone obsolescence, so I agreed. I ordered the iPhone 15. 

Today, I have my new shiny phone, but what issue plagues and haunts me still? No data even though I have full bars.

I’ve worked in medium/higher volume stores, as a RIS during the Sprint merger, in outbound sales, and for the last two years in SiS. I recently moved into the Experience role and I’m realizing how much I’ve fallen behind on a few key skills.

Lately I’ve been:  
• Taking way too long with customers even on simple upgrades.  
• Struggling to complete all steps in trade in processes like Find My iPhone removal and starting the security delay removal early etc. Basically just not being efficient or thorough.  
• Not confident using or troubleshooting T-LIFE or using Tapestry to complete trade-in's or transactions etc.  
• Having trouble remembering to touch on everything like Business, HSI, P360, AAL opportunities and Plan Migrations.  
• Failing to close with that Plus One mentality everyone else seems to have.

I know I have the potential I’ve just lost my rhythm. I want to get better at time management during transactions while still creating great experiences.

If anyone’s been in this boat especially in Experience or SiS roles:  
• How did you get faster and more consistent without cutting corners?  
• Do you have workflows or mental checklists that help you stay on track?  
• How do you ask discovery questions confidently when you’re already behind on time?  
• How do you recover mid interaction when you realize you’re taking too long?

I love this company and I’m proud of my years here but right now I feel like I’m falling behind in both skill and confidence. I’d love any advice from reps or leaders who’ve rebuilt their flow or mastered efficiency at the kiosk level.

I was recently prompted by T-Mobile to switch to the new white 5G gateway from my Nokia gateway. Y'all helped me figure out how to rename and modify the SSID and the security level so all my light bulbs, thermostats, Ring devices, TV's, streaming devices, tablets, Phyn, YoLink and laptop would reconnect. All that went smoothly but then I started getting ridiculously low download and upload speeds, like less than 1 Mbps. I chatted with T-Force last week about 8 pm on Twitter to make sure there was no maintenance or congestion in my area. There wasn't.

The rep wanted me to swap out my new gateway for another one but I had been through that rodeo with my Nokia. I must have swapped out 4 or 5 of them until I found a post on Reddit that recommended sitting the gateway on an electronics fan to cool it. I ordered an electronics fan from Amazon, sat my Nokia on it, and my speed issues disappeared. When I set up the 5G gateway, I tried to sit it on the fan but that wasn't going to work so I put it away. But while chatting with the T-Force rep and learning there was no ongoing maintenance or congestion, I decided to grab the fan and set it up on its side so that it would blow into the (cooling?) holes in the back of the gateway. Voila, my download and upload speeds went back to normal. It seems I was having the same overheating issue with the new gateway as I was having with the old Nokia gateway. I will try to post pictures of my setup so you can see there is no reason why the this gateway (or my Nokia) should overheating.

Haven't seen this question asked in quite some time...

  
I occasionally work remote from my vehicle and would like to improve my Internet connectivity. I was headed the route of Starlink Mini (tech side of me loves it), but since most of my work is in the city with 5G coverage, it seems like T-Mobile is likely the more economical option.

If I update my plan to something like the MAXup Data with 40gb of Hostpot Data (+$15/mo) - see snip, can I change it back to Magenta at any time? I want to confirm that I will not lose the ability to go backwards to my base Magenta plan.

I’ve been a loyal T-Mobile customer for over a decade and moved my business account over a few years back. Recently, I tried to upgrade two lines to the new iPhone 17 series. I was promised a specific promo: trade in one phone, get a discount on the other, and keep my existing business plan.

Instead, the rep processed it as two new lines, sent the wrong colors to the wrong address (without an order or authorization from me), and now customer care says I have to return the phones (which are already activated) just to fix their mistake. I’m about to travel internationally, and waiting for a callback days from now isn’t feasible. I didn’t ask for new lines, just a simple upgrade, and now I’m stuck with extra charges.

How do I escalate this beyond the supervisor who isn’t helping? Is there a specific title or department in T-Mobile Business I should be asking for? Any tips on how to handle this kind of situation would be super appreciated. Thanks!",0,1,0.074,0.81,0.116,0.8733

tmobile,post,1oluxv5,2025-11-01 13:19:17,"Spoke to T-Mobile supervisor today and was told it is LEGAL for an account holder to utilize Digits to access SMS text messages WITHOUT the consent of the additional line. I have recently had a problem with a ex partner whose plan I was on for over two years. I quickly began receiving text messages regarding digits and his email address accessing my phone number. The text message specifically asked to call T-Mobile if I did not authorize this. I called T-Mobile several times over the course of a few months with absolutely no help and not much information regarding the digits app and what it was used for but also what it could be abused for. I dealt with gaslighting manipulation and lying for over two years about this app until I finally had enough proof that he was forced to admit it. I called t-Mobile this morning for something unrelated ended up sharing my story with a woman who said she would do have an investigation done asked for his phone number and would look into the process of when I was on his account and then when I got my own account. I had to call back a couple of hours later as I was unable to log into my digits because it was still showing my old phone number which concerned me because I also found in my phone a screenshot of a private conversation about him with! At the top right corner when I Google reversed search the image, it said that it had to be a dual Sim phone. So my main concern was getting into my digit app with my new phone number. I spoke with an associate for an hour and also the supervisor who said that in the paperwork it is 100% legal for cellular services to have their account holders have access to that information and it is on the fine print that we sign. I then did my own research and looks in fact that that is not true and he was lying. I was simply asking for a complaint be made possibly an investigation solely for the purpose that I never gave consent for my text messages to be read for two years, and I was constantly calling the company trying to get help and was unable to receive any he told me that he was unable to help me And that everything that they were doing was legal. I asked for the corporate number they said they do not have one I don’t know where to go from here. I feel like this is not only unethical illegal, but also making it easy for abusive partners to gain control of their victims by accessing Their life through their cell phone. The mental and emotional abuse that this can cause is unexplainable. I don’t know who to report this to. I don’t know how to take this step further because I do believe that it absolutely should be because I know I’m not the only person that is either knowingly or unknowingly going through this right now if anyone has any insight or any stories related to this, please share I am so sorry that it’s so long

tmobile,post,1olm2id,2025-11-01 07:02:28,"Buyer’s remorse account credit (iPhone 17PM) Just for some background context, I opened a T-Mobile business account in early 2024 primarily to use their cellular tablets to monitor ELD devices like my iPad mini for CDL driving purposes. Shortly after the Apple event, I pre-ordered the iPhone 17 Pro Max and ordered it over the phone. I was torn between the regular Pro and Pro Max models, and the representative explained the return policy. I opted for the pro max received the phone, but it was just too big.

I called T-Mobile and they issued a return under their “buyer’s remorse” policy, sending me an email with a prepaid return label. A few days later, I received the new regular Pro and boxed up the 17 Pro Max, sending it back to a T-Mobile facility in Texas. It was delivered back in early October, but my account still shows that I owe the cost of the phone, around $1200. I waited a week or so and still didn’t see any credit, so I called 611. I spoke with someone who said it could take a few days, but another week went by with no progress.

Now, they want to suspend my service for non-payment on a device that I don’t even have in my possession anymore. I called again and explained the situation, but they kept saying it would take a few more days.

Here we are, at the beginning of November, and my account still hasn’t been credited. For some additional context, I pre-ordered the new M5 iPad Pro via Apple.com, which arrived on October 22nd along with a return kit to trade in my M4 iPad Pro. I boxed it up the same day and sent it back. They received the old M4 iPad Pro on Monday, October 27th, and by Tuesday, October 28th, my original payment method was credited for the trade-in.

In my opinion, T-Mobile needs to improve its returns process. Has anyone else experienced a similar issue? I feel like I’ve spoken to the T-Mobile representatives until I’m blue in the face. I’m assuming they must contract a third-party company to handle these returns, but it seems ridiculous that it would take three to four weeks to scan a phone into their system and credit my account.

A few weeks ago, I received an email stating that they had received the device, checked its IMEI, condition, and so on, and that everything was in order. What gives here? ",12,17,0.028,0.907,0.065,0.9474

We can complain, T-Mobile will fix it, eventually all carriers will adopt the same move but AT&T and Verizon will be far behind because T-Mobile has been working at this for the last 3 years. They have been pushing app adoption with incentives for years.

tmobile,post,1okiwc4,2025-10-30 21:22:50,"4 New Devices - Beyond Plan - Help Hello. Tonight, my family went to t-mobile to ask about switching over from Verizon wireless. There are 4 of us and we would be transferring over our numbers and would all be trading in our current iphones for 4 new phones (3 iPhone 17 pro max, and 1 iPhone 17 pro). The current promotion for 3 of us would be $830 off and then one of us had the offer for $1,100 for trading in their phone. 



We ran into a bit of a snag however when we found out at the end of the process (of course) that we would need to pay a down payment today for $1,424 due to the 4 new iPhones.

  
My question is, is there a work around for this? Could two of us switch over to T-mobile now and get the discounts/deals for the iPhone trade-ins and then like a few weeks or a month later, add the other 2 lines to avoid having to pay that massive down payment? Would all the lines still receive the same discounts/promotions?

tmobile,post,1okfaki,2025-10-30 18:36:11,"Confusing T-Mobile trade-in message after Costco promo I took advantage of the recent Costco + T-Mobile promo that offered $150 plus a free iPhone 17 Pro with the trade-in of an eligible device (in my case, an iPhone 15 Pro Max).

However, I got this confusing text from T-Mobile this morning:

“T-Mobile: Looks like there was a mix up—the make, model, or memory of your quoted device doesn’t match what we received or it was damaged. We will adjust your trade-in value to $355.00 because of this difference. For more details, please visit t-mo.co/mytradein24”

I’m scratching my head because:
	•	The model and memory definitely match what I submitted.
	•	Even if there was minor damage, this promo was supposed to accept any eligible phone in any condition.

I tried calling customer service, but they transferred me to Assurant (the trade-in partner), and they had no idea what was going on.

What’s the best way to get this resolved? Should I go back to the Costco T-Mobile kiosk where I did the trade-in, or is there a better contact path for this kind of issue?

Any advice or similar experiences would be super helpful. I just don’t want to lose out on the promo because of some mix-up.

When the iPhone 17s came out, I called T-Mobile to preorder the iPhone 17 directly with a representative specifically so I wouldn’t mess anything up. On that call, I made it crystal clear I was interested in the “iPhone 17 on Us” promo. I also repeated multiple times: no trade-in, no port-in, brand new number, brand new plan. The rep told me yes, that I qualify not once, but several times!!

We went through the preorder together. Everything looked fine, I read every document they sent me, and nowhere did it say I wasn’t eligible. No mention of trade-ins, no hidden requirements, no follow-up emails about trading in a phone absolutely nothing.

Fast-forward to now, and suddenly I’m being charged monthly for the phone because apparently I “wasn’t eligible” for the promo. When I called in and got escalated, the rep straight-up ghosted me mid-conversation once I started backing up my points with facts. They told me they can’t honor the promo unless I have a trade-in, which I made clear from day one I didn’t have.

I even asked if they could pull the recorded call since it would prove exactly what I was told. I only went with T-Mobile because of that promo.. otherwise, I would’ve gone with another carrier. So yeah, I absolutely believe I’m entitled to the promo I was promised.

Now my bill is $280/month for two lines when my budget is around $200 or less. I’m not trying to pay $900 for a phone that was supposed to be “free on them.”

This whole experience has left such a bad taste in my mouth. It’s not my fault their rep gave me false info, and now Im stuck in a contract because of their negligence. This freakin sucks.

Edit: amidst the iPhone 17 drop I was comparing promos and prices amongst different carriers. I called to stay factual and on the right track. I didn’t expect to be misinformed.

Edit: thank you to all the comments with actual advice. Not the ones blaming me. I thought it was smart to confirm with a rep but those of you saying I should’ve read more, you sure are damn right.

The  agent from redeem department basically saying he would give me 120 days extension rather than the 30 days from T Mobile website. When I asked him to sent me this via email( which he just emailed me the promotion link) he simply refused.

tmobile,post,1ojm1df,2025-10-29 19:52:43,"Dual-eSIM with T-Satellite Hi all,

I am in the US and have an unlocked iPhone 13 running iOS 26.0.1.

I currently have two eSIMs provisioned:
1. My primary carrier (not T-Mobile), which is linked to my main phone number.
2. T-Satellite-only service.

**Question**

Is it possible to use the primary carrier’s SMS messaging via T-Satellite’s satellite service?

If so, what settings do I need to configure?

Thank you.

**Desired Behavior**

I’d like to be able to send and receive SMS messages using my primary carrier’s number using T-Satellite’s satellite connection when out of terrestrial service coverage, such as when camping in remote areas.

**Observed Behavior**

When out of range of terrestrial networks, the phone switches to T-Satellite’s SAT connection and I can send and receive SMS messages via the T-Satellite connection with the T-Satellite eSIM’s phone number and use satellite-approved apps like AllTrails.

However, the primary carrier shows only as “No Service” and I cannot send or receive SMS messages using the primary carrier’s number.

At one point in the past during the T-Satellite beta, the desired behavior occurred for a while, but I have been unable to replicate it.

**iPhone 13 Supports Desired Behavior**

[Apple’s support page 109317](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109317) (in the “Learn about Dual SIM status icons”) indicates this is possible using the phone’s WiFi calling feature even if no WiFi network is in range. (Searching on Reddit indicates this feature is commonly used with international travel using a local data-only SIM in the foreign country for the data connection.)

Specifically, the figure showing “Carrier 1” as the data connection, and “Carrier 2 using Cellular Data” shows the configuration I’d like to use, with Carrier 1 being T-Satellite and Carrier 2 being my primary carrier. 

**Existing Settings**

In my phone’s “Settings —> Cellular” menu, the primary carrier is set as the default for voice and cellular data. Allow Cellular Data Switching is enabled. Both eSIMs have Wi-Fi calling enabled. This works as expected, with data and calls/SMS going over the primary carrier and the T-Mobile eSIM being active but idle.

In some areas, the T-Mobile terrestrial signal is better, so I change the setting to use the T-Satellite eSIM for data (keeping the primary for voice), and again, this works as expected, with the phone connecting to T-Mobile’s terrestrial towers for data and calls/SMS going over the primary carrier’s network.

When I go camping in an area that lacks terrestrial coverage from both carriers I always set the Cellular Data to the T-Satellite eSIM and keep the voice set to the primary carrier’s eSIM as shown on the [T-Mobile’s support page describing how to configure a phone to use the service](https://www.t-mobile.com/support/coverage/satellite-support#using).

Edit: added link to Apple’s support page and the T-Mobile configuration page for clarity.

1) Am I responsible for paying the $780 to AT&T upfront *before* the port-in is possible? Or does the port-in happen and then I use the prepaid Mastercard at a later time to settle my balance with AT&T?

2) If I have to settle the balance first, does anyone know if it is possible to move the $780 from the prepaid Mastercard to a checking account or alternatively use it to pay a credit card bill.

3) Is this deal affected by my status as a previous, *but not current*, T-Mobile account holder? I had cellular service with T-Mobile at the end of 2024, but switched to AT&T in January of 2025 for a lot of promises that were unmet. Now I am looking to return to T-Mobile.

Edit, with clarification.  TMO just eliminated the loophole where if you keep a debit card on file for autopay and prepay with a credit card, you would be able to get credit card benefits. Now, if you prepay with a credit card, you will lose the $5 per line autopay discount.  My question is if you use a Visa or Master Card gift card, to prepay, would you lose the autopay discount?  From some of the responses, it seems like if you use a gift card, you will lose the autopay discount because it is treated as a credit card, even though they are debit cards.

I am incredibly disappointed with what T-Mobile has become. Once upon a time, your marketing slogan was to be the ""uncarrier"" and be above the rest in how you treated your customers.

I was on AT&T and was gearing up for an extended trip out of the country.

I was paying AT&T $85/month for an unlimited plan, but they charge $25/day for roaming, and T-Mobile's $85/month plan included international coverage. Plus, I got a ""free"" iPhone 16 Pro and some rebates from the switch, which seemed like a no-brainer.

On June 27th, I went to my local retail T-Mobile store, got all set up, had some hiccups with the rebate, but everything was sorted out, and I walked out the door with my new phone.

I traveled to Portugal on July 12th, a country on T-Mobile's roaming list. Upon landing in Lisbon, I turned on roaming only to see an ""E"" for my cellular speeds. I chalked that up to me being at the airport, and maybe my phone needed to do some handshakes with the LTE/5G towers, which hadn't happened yet.

After a few days at my destination in Cascais, Portugal, I am still stuck on 2G/E speeds. I called T-Mobile to find out what was going on. After an hour or so of troubleshooting, I'm still only getting 2G/E speeds. The technical support agent says that since the towers are from Vodafone, he cannot do much more and blames network congestion for being downgraded to those speeds. Disappointing, but whatever.

I asked if there's anything we can do about letting me add a secondary eSIM to my device. However, since my phone is technically financed through the promotion, it's carrier-locked. T-Mobile will not allow me to add a secondary eSIM. Again, disappointed, but I get it.

Two weeks pass, and my friend, who also uses T-Mobile, comes by. She has an iPhone 13 Mini. I ask her how her coverage has been... 5G speeds... My iPhone 16 Pro is sitting directly beside her iPhone 13; all I get is E/2G, while she gets 5G.

Now, it's clear that something more is going on than network congestion; something is wrong. I called T-Mobile again to troubleshoot. After another hour of troubleshooting, we did have an improvement. If I reboot my phone, I will get 5G speeds, but after a few hours, I will be downgraded back to E/2G speeds and have to reboot my phone again.

I put up with that for a few more weeks, but the final straw broke when a call I was having was dropped 3 times. At this point, it was clear I had made a mistake switching to T-Mobile.

I called T-Mobile within my return window to initiate the return and cancellation of my service. Unfortunately, I would not be stateside again until after the 30-day return window. After some back-and-forth with the retention agent, he agreed to make an exception and allow a longer return window. On that call, he said I would have my final bill after the device was returned in August.

I landed back in the States on August 3rd. When I was home, I opened an account with Visible, activated my iPhone 14 Pro, and ported my number over. I removed the eSIM from my tablet and Apple Watch. The iPhone 16 Pro from T-Mobile was dropped off at UPS the next day, on August 4th.

When my number was ported over, my T-Life app became only a portal to pay bills, so I assumed my account was cancelled.

I got my bill for August and paid it.

September comes around, and I'm charged again via AutoPay. This is a mistake, so I call T-Mobile yet again.

I explained the situation, and they told me the account was not closed because I still had my watch and tablet line on T-Mobile. I explained that it was unclear whether the account was still active since my T-Life app was practically empty. They explained I should have called to confirm. I explained that the retention agent told me my last bill would be August. They said they checked the recordings, but could not find where he said that...

Since the eSIMs were removed on August 3rd, I asked them to check the logs. My devices had not touched the T-Mobile network since August 3rd. I asked for the bill to be refunded since I believed it was in error. The agent said they would escalate my request to a supervisor, and I should receive a call back within 48 hours.

I did not receive a call, but when I saw the $85 come back to my account, I figured all was well. That is, until I received a letter from a debt collector.

I called T-Mobile again. When I reviewed the situation again, their side of the story was a bit different. According to this agent, the account was canceled, but since I was a few days into the new billing cycle, the whole billing cycle was assessed.

It's a different story, but I take him at his word. Since I did not access the network for the entire cycle, I asked if we could do a prorated bill instead of the whole cycle. He refused.

I asked to escalate to a supervisor, and when I talked to her, all she did was threaten to send me to collections if I didn't pay the full bill.

So I just paid it. $85 is not worth a collection on my credit report.

For a company that markets itself as more caring than the rest, I hoped to find a middle ground where we're all happy. I gave T-Mobile plenty of opportunity to help and make it right. Instead, T-Mobile used its leverage to extract $85 from me and has lost any recommendation of my own and my business forever.

Still, I'm a drop in the bucket for a $300B company.",78,73,0.061,0.87,0.069,0.8438

me ""I've got a W Fast 5688 box. I want port forwarding and a static ip address.""  
phone rep ""What do you want it for?  
me: ""I want to run a backup server and access it while I'm not at the house.""

me ""Normally? That is to say there are exceptions?""

phone rep ""I'll see what I can do"" (so they can do something? great!)  
phone rep ""It looks like it can be done. It'll cost another 3 dollars a month for that.""  
me ""that's not so bad. Sure. let's do it!""  
phone rep ""I'll have to transfer you to someone to handle it.""  
me ""okay, sure.""

30 minutes on hold later....  
  
phone rep ""unfortunately we're closing. You'll have to call back tomorrow.""  
me ""okay... I guess I can do that. But this is really taking a long time. I guess I'll call tomorrow""

So sure, hours happen. Whatever, that's not really on them, barring keeping me on hold for an hour. (with assorted smaller holds during. Since they had to look up account info or something.)

So I call back.  
me ""I want port forwarding and a static ip address. I was told that would be another 3 dollars a month or something.""

30 minute again....  
  
billing rep ""hello. how can I help?""

rep ""I'll see what I can do. unfortunately, you're on a home account. But we can upgrade you""  
me ""Yeah, that was a 3 dollar charge for all that, right?""  
rep ""Yeah, 3 dollars for the transfer.""  
me ""I can do that. no problem.""  
rep ""okay, but being a new account type, the billing is different. It's 3 dollars for the feature and your monthly bill is actually going to double because it's not a home account then. Is that okay?"" (Why am I ONLY hearing that the cost is doubling now?!)  
me ""No, no it isn't. I can't really afford that huge jump.""  
rep ""okay, thanks for calling. goodbye!""



Like what the actual hell? I went from ""it's doable. just ask"" to ""3 dollars"" to ""we're wanting to double your bill"" and this took 4+ hours being passed between lines for a feature that SHOULD be available by default.

tmobile,post,1oicgjl,2025-10-28 10:28:52,"T-Mobile won’t refund me for WiFi gateway I returned — they “can’t find my account” even though I used their service for 2 years Hey everyone, I’m hoping someone here can give me some advice because I’ve been going in circles with T-Mobile for months.

I used T-Mobile’s home internet for over two years and returned my WiFi gateway in **August**. T-Mobile gave me the **air waybill and tracking number** for the return, and I confirmed through the tracking info that **their warehouse received the device**.

However, I never got my refund. When I called customer service, they told me they **can’t find my name under the account number I gave** and therefore can’t issue a refund because “there’s no existing account.” (I am also very frustrated because customer service kept hanging up on me and i would have to repeat the same information multiple times) 

The thing is — **I was the only person ever on that account**, and I’ve been using the wifi service from T-Moblie for two years. Somehow, they’re saying the account is now under someone else’s name and they cannot find any information that it ever was associated with me.

One rep told me to go to a T-Mobile store to verify my ID. I did — the employee there was super nice and even called customer support for me. The rep on the phone confirmed that my return was received and said they’d reach out to me within **2–3 business days**.

It’s been weeks, and no one has reached out. I called again, and now they’re back to saying they **can’t find the account** and that I need to go to the store *again* to verify my ID and to get the refund.

At this point, I’m just really frustrated. Even if I’m no longer an active customer, they should still have my account information since I had their WiFi for two years and returned their equipment properly.

Has anyone else dealt with this or know what I can do next? Should I escalate this somewhere (like corporate or FCC)?

tmobile,post,1ohs5yn,2025-10-27 17:09:53,"Hitting P360 goals as a COR ME is an absolute nightmare I've been with T-Mobile for about a year and half at a high volume corporate store - ever since they switched out our feature revenue goals for P360 goals, it's been an absolute nightmare especially when it comes to having whatever you sell report properly.

As a rep, I generally hate doing plan changes (what our previous feature goals were used for) because most of the time it doesn't make sense financially for both myself and the customer. I've always preferred to maximize revenue with AAL promos, watches, tablets, and P360. But generally as a goal, tracking all the feature revenue you've made throughout the month made so much more sense to me since I could easily figure out how I can affect that goal and when that goal would update. When they announced the change, I thought it would track the same; where it would just show up once the customer gets billed for it (since P360 always gets back dated usually the next day).

Yet no matter what I do, my numbers never update unless I add the absolute highest tier (the $18 dollar one) specifically on a line upgrade. You wanna put insurance on the line the customer wants to actually use after selling a BOGO AAL promo? Forget about it. Lower insurance tier? Doesn't work. P360 already on the phone number? Good luck.

Our DM has repeatedly told everyone in our district that lower insurance tiers and upgrades on an existing P360 line count towards goals, but I just don't see it. It's been months and P360 has consistently been the hardest mandatory goal to hit for me (along with T-Life but that's a whole other can of worms). 

I consistently hit top 20 every month in my district when it comes to all my other goals so you could probably imagine seeing that one weak goal there really sucks. I just don't understand how they're actually tracking it, it all feels wrong. It feels like they're trying to prioritize JUST doing upgrades and upselling insurance (which don't get me wrong 8 out of 10 sales I will say I do succesfully pitch), which doesn't make sense at all. Why would I make both myself AND the company less money?

Sometimes it really feels like the C-suite at T-Mobile smokes way too much crack. It's just been stupid decision after stupid decision non-stop.

- I wanted to trade my old iPhone in for a newer model and the rep said I could do a BOGO deal to get an additional phone, which I didn’t know prior meant an extra line. So the paid line is my iPhone and the free line is the other phone.

- If I cancel either of the lines, or rather any line (we had 4 existing paid lines, now we have 6) within one years time the promotion for the phone will be revoked.

My question is after the one year period has passed can I only cancel my old paid lines that weren’t part of the BOGO? So I would need to port those devices over to the free and paid BOGO lines and get rid of two older ones.

**BACKGROUND:**

I used to be with AT&T and was paying around $280 a month for 3 lines (Me and my two little brothers). I have a lot of younger siblings and as the third oldest, I wanted to get 2 of my other little siblings phones as one is entering middle school and the other is entering high school.

  
Every time I visit Costco, I see T-Mobile representatives/employees at their booth trying to get people to switch over. After multiple visits and thinking of my family, I decided to give it a shot. Their offer was that by switching over to T-Mobile, I get brand new iPhone 16s and they'll pay off all remaining phone balances from AT&T and reward me with multiple $75 and $150 Costco gift cards. Since my two little brothers only had iPhone 10s, I thought this was a sweet deal since it'll be a huge upgrade along with the amount of Visa gift cards I'll be receiving. I paid an upfront payment of around $750 and was told they'll pay me back over two years (I still don't know how this works).

**BILLING:**  
After all of that, my bill came out to be $380.70 for 5 phone lines and from the current $280 for 3 lines, this seemed like a way better deal compared to AT&T. But then I came to this sub reddit and decided to glance over at what other's payments are, I am now questioning my phone bill. Others in this sub reddit are saying that they are paying around $190 to $200 for 5 phone lines while mine is almost $400 a month, it makes me doubt whether or not I got scammed? Any thoughts? I have been paying this phone bill for 3 months now and it makes me really question whether or not I made the correct choice...

$380.70 a month for 5 T-Mobile lines, is that too much?",3,53,0.02,0.941,0.04,0.7438

I was thinking that we can upgrade to experience beyond, upgrade our 4 phones on the paid line, then drop the free line and use work perks to get it down to $221 (since work perks can’t be used with free lines).

I also was told that we cannot upgrade for 90 days if we drop any line, so that’s why I was thinking of dropping it later. We also want the yearly upgrade.

In late 2022 I went to a store to get a new phone, and a dishonest salesman tricked me into signing up for a new plan with multiple ""dummy lines"" that'd be cheaper than a single phone line because of some promotion, and told me when the promotion ended I'd be able to cancel the unused lines. 

Then in mid/late 2023 I noticed they were charging me a lot, like $160/month. I called customer service and they told me the salesman was wrong and I couldn't make any changes to the plan until Aug 2024. 

So I waited almost a year, and then called in Aug 2024 to get it sorted out. I was given a lot of run-around over the next month, sent into stores and told to call different numbers, but they were determined to keep charging me for lines that don't exist. 

At this point, I went through the process to have my plan cancelled. I signed up with Verizon in mid Sept 2024, and after multiple phone calls with T-Mobile and making multiple payments to them over the phone to ensure every penny they deemed that I was contractually obligated to was 100% paid off, they assured me that the account was being closed and that I would not be charged another penny. 

At this point, they also cut off all my access to their online platforms, so I had no way of obtaining proof or documentation, though at the time I just foolishly believed them. In the subsequent months, they kept charging my card, and then I'd wind up in long phone calls with them where they'd eventually admit that the plan should have been cancelled, they'd promise to refund the money but then they wouldn't, and I'd get charged again. This went on for months last fall/winter. 

Finally last February they refunded 2 of the 3 erroneous charges, but then they started sending bills for the erroneous charges they just refunded, plus a new erroneous charge. The last time I called they said it's in collections now so they can't do anything. And now a collection agent is saying I owe over $600. 

It seems I have no recourse because I didn't realize I needed to document every interaction or they'd just get away with lying to me and then charging me hundreds and hundreds of dollars for a cancelled service, after they'd already overcharged me more than a thousand dollars.

tmobileisp,post,1oq7qy9,2025-11-06 13:04:43,"VPN Suddenly Stopped Working Between 5688W and Meraki MR56 About a year ago, my company issued out certificate-based authentication for 802.1x for WiFi access, which broke my ability to connect to the corporate SSID of a Meraki MR56 they gave me to work from home. It just waits forever for a server response. T-Mobile sent a 5688W which inexplicably fixed it.

Fast-forward to a month ago, and the issue came back. My IT is not clearly saying if they pushed a profile update to the Meraki or if T-Mobile made a change. T-Mobile exchanged if for a G4AR, but the issue is continuing.

Based on thread posts here, I told my IT there's some known MTU issues for VPN, and since I have access to our IT's ticket system, I could find other similar cases opened within my company and even an internal support article explaining they verified that due to MTU limits with T-Mobile. The article had a PCAP analysis proving that a certificate response is not able to make it from the authentication server, through T-Mobile, and to a client computer to allow it to connect to the corporate SSID. After a  month of back-and-forth, they offered to test pushing a profile to the Meraki with a lower MTU.

Now, they suddenly said it's too risky. They apparently are not willing to make a custom profile for me and said any MTU change would impact all employees who work from home. Thankfully, soft VPN works, but I really prefer hardware VPN. I sometimes need to use that software VPN client to connect to even more restricted subnets in my corporate network. If the client is being used for basic connectivity, that's not possible.

I just got an AT&T Air 5G modem, but my area clearly has no 5G at all. It locks onto band 2 and is getting 10% the speeds of T-Mobile. It does work fine with the Meraki, but I just can't justify this as a real solution.

Are there any other options here? I suspect not since the packet holding the certificate response is dropping in transit between our authentication server and something in the T-Mobile network.

Immediately, my iPhone 14 began acting up. Spotify said I was offline, sometimes saying offline/online in rapid succession but always going back to offline. No email connectivity on cellular data. Very little app connectivity. I can text but no pictures will go through. Calls and text work.** 



I went to the tmobile store and one person tried resetting my network settings. When that didn’t work, another associate said I just need a new phone. So, I reluctantly bought an iPhone 17 pro from apple (I do not buy from my carrier). The new phone has all the problems as the old phone. 



I went back to the tmobile store and an associate told me to get ANOTHER new phone and ‘start from scratch.’ 



I went home and got on a chat with both tmobile and apple. Apple said there was something wrong with my cell service and to take my phone into an authorized service provider to see if they can help. Tmobile told me on the chat that there was a ‘network ticket’ that needed to be resolved but after that everything should be good. When I took my phone to the geek squad they ran diagnostics and said the hardware is all fine but there was some kind of cell issue with diagnostics run with apple the day before but they couldn’t tell me what, that the cell signal and everything checked out with their diagnostics.

I don't have debit auto-pay so was expecting my plan to be $35. Confirmed that with the representative doing my switch. So new billing period goes in effect, and my plan is now $40 + taxes.

Best she could do is give me a one-time $15 credit and told me to look out for any potential promotions during thanks giving.

So did my bill go down, yes, by just a few bucks. But my taxes are no longer inclusive and thus subject to increases. And the $30 TMHI promotion really ends up being $35 with autopay.

Throughout this, I will be using the terms WiFi and internet interchangeably, which I hope will not cause any confusion. I know little technical jargon and most if not all of my knowledge about tech support comes from online sources. 

The home internet works, according to a T-Mobile support member. However, whenever we connect our devices, they all show the same thing: No internet.

As shown in the pictures attached, no internet, despite the gateway saying “Your connection is very good.” What?

It is very sporadic. There are times when my laptop or my dad’s laptop will connect and have a really good connection. Yet all good things must come to an end, and it always goes back to the same thing: No internet. 

The support rep claimed that there was something within our devices that prevent it from connecting. Everything was supposedly working fine on their end. 

So here is what we have tried:
* Firstly, T-Mobile reset the internet on their side when we called support. Result: No internet.
* After resetting and using the the T-Mobile home internet app to connect, it puts us in a loop of trying to connect to the gateway before making us sign in with admin password and WiFi name again and again and again.
* I reset my network settings on my laptop, then connected to the wifi again. Result: No internet 
* I turned off the private network firewall on my laptop, connected to the WiFi.  Result: No internet. 
* Resetting the gateway to factory default settings, which we could not do fully. Online search results said that if it was stuck resetting for more than 20 minutes, it was either frozen or failed, so we unplugged the power, waited 60 seconds, then turned it on again. Result: No internet. 

Is there something else we need to try? Do we need to get a replacement? We’ve had this home internet for more than a year. It has always worked until now and it’s been like this for days.

Hey folks, 3 months Metro PCS 5G home internet user here (unlimited plan, $40/mo with autopay + bundle discount for phone lines). Been loving the speeds after some tweaks, but uploads were stuck at ~7 Mbps and overnight drops to LTE-only were killing my late-night vibes. 
Decided to upgrade to a G4AR for those sweet external antenna ports to boost my marginal n41 signal (Poor RSRP/SINR most nights).
Snagged a brand-new TMO-G4AR on eBay. 
Popped in my SIM from the 5688W, powered up... and boom: 5 full signal bars (excellent!), my assigned Metro phone number registers perfectly, and it's locked on 5G SA mode. Metrics look golden—Good RSRQ, Good SINR, n41 band. But... no internet. WiFi connects, but zero data flow. Speed tests time out, no IP assignment. It's like it's authenticated but not provisioned for actual browsing.
Called Metro CS to get the IMEI updated (as they provision gateways by IMEI for home internet). Rep said swaps aren't ""allowed"" but they'd try the update anyway""no guarantees though."" .
So, I gave up at this time.
Daytime on the old 5688W? Hitting 600+ Mbps down / 30+ up after elevating it near a window. Phone (S22) maxes ~600/15, but gateway was the king.

I'm in a pretty dead area, so had been getting around 100 down/15 up. Honestly, it's been fine for our needs... wife and I both work remotely and it was enough to support simultaneous video conferences and was fine for streaming in HD. I didn't have any real complaints.

With the G5AR, I immediately got better download speeds... generally between 200 and 400mbps. However, my download speeds were around 6-8mbps, which had me a bit concerned for remote work. I've moved it around and gotten a location where I'm getting a pretty consistent 200-250 down and 25-30 up. I'm happy with it, but have found that if I move the modem to a slightly higher spot (even by 12 inches), I can get up 400-500 down, but then my upload speeds suffer again.

Still searching for the sweet spot... but looking for any suggestions that might help. TIA!

I used T-Mobile’s home internet for over two years and returned my WiFi gateway in **August**. T-Mobile gave me the **air waybill and tracking number** for the return, and I confirmed through the tracking info that **their warehouse received the device**.

However, I never got my refund. When I called customer service, they told me they **can’t find my name under the account number I gave** and therefore can’t issue a refund because “there’s no existing account.” (I am also very frustrated because customer service kept hanging up on me and i would have to repeat the same information multiple times)

The thing is — **I was the only person ever on that account**, and I’ve been using the wifi service from T-Moblie for two years. Somehow, they’re saying the account is now under someone else’s name and they cannot find any information that it ever was associated with me.

One rep told me to go to a T-Mobile store to verify my ID. I did — the employee there was super nice and even called customer support for me. The rep on the phone confirmed that my return was received and said they’d reach out to me within **2–3 business days**.

It’s been weeks, and no one has reached out. I called again, and now they’re back to saying they **can’t find the account** and that I need to go to the store *again* to verify my ID and to get the refund.

At this point, I’m just really frustrated. Even if I’m no longer an active customer, they should still have my account information since I had their WiFi for two years and returned their equipment properly.

Has anyone else dealt with this or know what I can do next? Should I escalate this somewhere (like corporate or FCC)?

I have access to the guest wifi at the marina, but its awful and far away, so I opted for a t-mobile plan for 50$ a month. Its been about a year now, and the internet problem is driving me crazy. It works great until it doesn't. 

  
most of the posts/comments in this subreddit after browsing for a bit seem to be concerned with maximum speed possible. I could not care less about speeds above 100mbps. I want a consistent signal for stability while gaming, and nothing else. I'd sacrifice 3/4 of my speed to have a perfect stable signal. 

  
the problem I have right now is inconsistency. In the last 30 minutes, I have lost connection for \~30 seconds 3 or 4 times. Sometimes I stay connected to the wireless LAN, and only lose my connection to the internet. Sometimes when it happens, I notice that in the bottom right corner of my PC that I am no longer connected to any network, and its usually ""stuck"" trying to re-connect to my TMO-g4AR network. There is no indication on the actual TMO-G4AR unit. So sometimes, the LAN goes down altogether, and sometimes its only the internet connection.

  
there seems to be some correlation between the movement of my boat on windy days within its slip and the disconnections. On particularly bad weather days where my boat is consistently turning a few degrees left and right, shifting in its slip etc, I notice that the connection/performance problems seem to happen much more often. On particularly calm days, I often have no problems at all for hours. If I take the boat out, the connection works great while I'm actually moving, although I haven't tested that much. It works great at distant anchorages, which I'm surprised at because I thought it was Geo-fenced.

I've tried going through the setup/calibration process on the unit, and have tried placing it in many locations in my boat. Its basically touching a huge window and facing out. I live in a populated area, not way in the middle of nowhere, so there are lots of radio towers nearby. Is my problem just that its switching towers constantly? Do I need an external antenna? Which one would you recommend for outdoor/marine use?

They advertise different plans for different prices yet the speeds are all the same, you’re only paying for more features and gimmicks that do not affect your internet speed in anyway like subscriptions to irrelevant services or promotions for phone plans. The cheapest plan and the most expensive advertised to me both had the same internet speeds, being 250MB/s-400MB/s. When I asked them on the phone at the time they said “the higher plans have an ‘internet booster’ that boosts your connection speed” I use Ethernet so an “internet booster” is completely useless for me. 

Cut to me switching over to them, within a week of service I already had issues, the amount of packet loss was insane. And it wasn’t on my end. I pinged the router from my computer and the connection from the router to my computer showed no packet loss. It’s all ISP sided issues.

**Phase 1:**    
The gateway hops from n41 to n71 nightly between 1 AM and 4 AM.  It happens on the same tower each time, then quickly, (within 10 minutes) switches to second tower.  There has never been drift from n71 back to n41.  Those only occur when I force a reboot. But each reboot has been on the n41 band and remains there until that 1-4AM overnight window.

 I'm not too familiar with how to interpret signal metrics, but here are the median and standard deviations of each.

I'm observing overall better performance on the n41 band. About 60% better DL, 20% better UL, and lower latency.

**Phase 2: I'm thinking of doing scheduled 6 AM reboots.  I'll probably stop with the logging and just confirm what band I'm on when I start my day.**  

**Original Post:**

I've seen a lot of posts about the upgrade offer and peoples experience and frustration.  I've commented in some of the threads, but I thought I'd run my own experiment and share my results.

I recently receive the offer to upgrade my trashcan style gateway (5G21) to a piece of trash gateway (G5AR).  I was excited at first, but quickly noticed that my speeds would deteriorate overnight until i rebooted.  I wanted to log this and prove what is happening with data.

So, I've been running HINT recording snapshots of my connected band and signals in 5 minute intervals.

tmobileisp,post,1of0t75,2025-10-24 10:28:44,"T-Mobile G5AR Gateway Experience: October 10th - October 23rd (The Wi-Fi Nightmare) I wanted to share my recent experience with the T-Mobile G5AR gateway, which I had from October 10th until October 23rd. The promise of a new, free upgrade from T-Mobile was appealing, but the reality was an absolute nightmare.

During those two weeks, the G5AR was defined by one issue: constant, frustrating Wi-Fi dropouts on every network. I tried contacting T-Force support multiple times, and predictably, they attempted to blame a nearby cellular tower. While they offered a \$55 credit for one month free on my all-in plan, I was convinced the modem itself was the problem, especially since my prior G4AR was flawless.
My suspicion was confirmed when I spoke to another user who received the G5AR and was facing the exact same consistent Wi-Fi instability.

On Thursday, October 23rd, I took the G5AR to a local T-Mobile store. I successfully swapped it out for the older, more reliable G4AR gateway, which, as I was told, is what most stores are currently carrying.

The Fix: As soon as I set up the G4AR at home, the problems vanished. I immediately had a perfect, stable internet connection with no more Wi-Fi drops.

This whole experience strongly suggests there is a significant, widespread issue with the G5AR gateway's Wi-Fi stability that T-Mobile is currently failing to acknowledge. For anyone else experiencing this, switching back to the G4AR (or an alternative) may be the only immediate solution.",20,40,0.084,0.765,0.151,0.9587

Previously on T-Mobile Is Affordable But Too Unstable: [The gateway ""upgrade"" brought lower speeds.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobileisp/comments/1ocywkh/g5ar_consistently_slower_than_nokia_can_tech/)

Called 611 at least three times in the last week. Each person shrugged. One finally heard me out: I hadn't been able to set anything up via the display QR code, and the T-Life app still showed my Nokia gateway even after setting up the G5AR. So! That rep reset my G5AR from their end, walked me through setup on the T-Life app, and we each did some tests from our respective sides. Faster! ~120 on the can, anywhere from ~40-140 initially on the G5AR, and finally up to 250-300 after resetting it. Solved!

Not really!

Somehow, lag became a MASSIVE issue. I can't explain it since Google speed test and speedtest.net still showed ~275, but on CoD Warzone, I was 10 seconds behind any button I pressed. I died before the parachute opened since it didn't register the button press. Then I could walk around in real time, but any button press took 10 seconds to register. Never seen anything like this weird combination of faster speeds yet slower-than-ever lag.

After a few matches, the G5AR stopped working completely. Wouldn't respond to any button presses on the gateway. Support said ""not to worry, the Home Internet team is available 24/7."" Yeah, they weren't. I waited 45 minutes before the rep said, ""Maybe call in the morning.""

And after putting the SIM back in the Nokia can, it doesn't work. I've power-cycled it several times and tried to restart it through the T-Life app. No connection.

This has been a goddamn nightmare.

Now I have to send the defective G5AR back, ask for a new one, see if it actually works this time, and meanwhile see why even the Nokia can isn't working now even with the SIM back in it.

I saw so many stories of higher speeds after swapping gateways. NOPE! I wish I'd never taken the bait from that upgrade text. Should've left well enough alone. Now I have no home internet, a defective newer unit, and a nonworking previous unit.

tmobileisp,post,1oer3rd,2025-10-24 02:11:03,"Inseego FX 4100 issues... I was sent an Inseego FX4100 after my G4SE started throwing constant errors. I actually asked for the G5AR, but support told me it was out of stock and offered this one instead. I did a quick search, saw it supported IP Passthrough (which I need so I can run my own router in full router mode), so I agreed to take it.

It did improve my speeds by about 200 Mbps on average, but the trade-off has been a nightmare. These are the main issues:

• IP Passthrough only works with IPv4, which forces my ASUS mesh into a double NAT unless I run it in AP mode.  
• My connection randomly drops to around 6 Mbps until I reboot the FX4100. This happens almost daily.  
• Smart home devices constantly fail to connect.  
• My Bambu Lab printers cannot be reached for remote printing anymore and updates fail after 2%.

Things I have already tried:

• Reset my Asus router  
• Tried using IP Passthrough with WiFi turned off on the Inseego  
• Tested different APN's  
• Tried using only 5G under the Network Technology  
• Tried changing the NAT Type to PRC (AI says the NAT Type is the issue)  
• Tried to get IPv6 passthrough working like it did on the G4SE. No luck.  
• Tried different DNS (in case AdGuard was causing problems).  
• Tried a separate router entirely.  
• Reset the Inseego router.

Switching back to my old cable ISP is tempting, but they have reliability issues whenever the weather changes a few degrees. T-Mobile has been great for general use, so I really want to make this work.

Going back to the G4SE is not an option either. I had packet loss, random disconnects while gaming, and video calls were nearly unusable because of audio delays.

Support has not been helpful so far. Most reps just read scripts without actually understanding what is going on and they are focused on empathy responses to relate to customers. I used to work in Tier II tech support from 2013 to 2016, so I know the difference.

Has anyone else run into these issues with the FX4100? Does anyone know the correct settings or something I can ask support to change on the backend provisioning?

Ideally, I would love to get the G5AR since it should give me similar or better speeds without these problems. I have business internet, but no static IP on the FX4100. The Bambu Lab issue is the most critical for me because I rely heavily on the app and LAN-only mode doesn’t give me the access I need.

But about a month ago, while the download speeds stayed roughly the same, my upload speeds tanked to a max of 7 Mbps (usually just 3–5 Mbps). Uploading video files now takes forever, so I was planning to buy a used T-Mobile G4AR gateway on eBay (the kind that supports an external antenna).

First, make sure if you don’t have it already, download and use the third-party HINT Control app. It provides a wealth of information in an easy to obtain fashion and is much better than the T-Life app to work with. Second, the WiFi on the G5 has issues if you plan on using it as a router and configuring an SSID that you presently use for existing devices. 

I was running an eero Pro 7 as the router on the Nokia and decided to see how the G5 would handle things without the eero in the mix. While configuration of the SSID on the G5 was pretty straightforward, once established I found my iOS devices (especially my iPhone Air) would constantly drop WiFi. As such, I’ve gone back to using the eero as the router and not a single drop out. Since you can’t turn WiFi broadcast totally off within the G5, I’ve configured it so that it only broadcasts on 2.4 and have hidden that SSID. Hopefully, upcoming firmware upgrades will address the WiFi drops.

I have done everything I can do to ensure the best QoS on this connection.

* Had tech support give me the G4AR and mesh add ons.
* Tech changed me to ""Internet Plus"" last year.
* Called a friend that contracts for all the providers, verified where my tower is located
* Moved my gateway up 10 feet into the top of the window to get the best line of sight.
* Verified my advanced metrics are the best they can be (and they are all ""excellent"" signal to noise etc)
* Verified I am connecting to dedicated 5G ONLY not LTE.

Yesterday I had the retail store near me switch me to the ""All in"" internet plan.

**Then things went horribly bad.**

I called customer service, they said that this plan is NOT available to me.

I went back to the store manager, he said ""oops sorry tell them to switch you back.""

Then customer service says ""i found a spot on the tower with my offline team, we can give you that service. It is reserved space, you won't get slowdowns and this will solve your issues.""

**This is a lie.**

They changed my address in the system to the new address, they reprovisioned the gateway... they verified the billing code was switched to ALL IN and told me to wait overnight.

**My ping is better... 15-30ms... but my service is just as bad.**

So now I am paying MORE for what I had, but I get 25-40mbps download speeds, which seems like a kick in the face to me.

I am currently trying to convince the cable company that I am NOT the person that used to live at my address, and I am NOT related to their $2200 past due balance.

After that, i will have to go with them, since TMO can't get their service to work for me.",0,1,0.074,0.805,0.121,0.9775

I’ve got **T-Mobile Fiber 2 Gbps**, and right now my setup is:  
**T-Mobile fiber (green SC/APC line) → Nokia ONT → Ethernet → UniFi Dream Machine Pro.**

I saw a Linus Tech Tips video where they plugged the green fiber straight into the UDM-Pro using an SFP adapter, skipping the ONT completely.

So I’m wondering:

* Can that be done with T-Mobile’s 2G fiber?
* What kind of SFP module would even work?
* Since T-Mobile uses **XGS-PON**, does that mean the Nokia ONT has to stay?
* Anyone actually bypass the Nokia box successfully?

If not, I’ll stick with ONT → Ethernet → UDM-Pro (or maybe use a **Ubiquiti UF-RJ45-10G** copper SFP for the WAN).

tmobileisp,post,1objka7,2025-10-20 08:53:05,"G4AR vs. FX4100: Conflicting Info on Xbox NAT Type and Static IP Hey everyone, I'm hoping to get some clarity on an Xbox gaming setup with T-Mobile Business Internet. I'm currently running a head-to-head comparison between T-Mobile and my existing Optimum cable connection, mainly comparing latency numbers but I can’t seem to get the T-Mobile gateway to work. I'm a total amateur when it comes to this kind of networking, so apologies if I use the wrong terms!

My primary goal is to hard-wire my Xbox to the T-Mobile gateway and achieve an Open NAT Type. I initially received the Inseego FX4100 gateway and after hours of trying to configure the settings to get an Open NAT, I got nowhere. I called T-Mobile Business support, and the technician explicitly told me that there is nothing you can do about the NAT type or port forwarding with the FX4100, so we will send you a G4AR instead.

This leads to my main questions: 1) Is the T-Mobile tech's claim true? Does the FX4100’s software genuinely prevent any kind of Port Forwarding or NAT customization, even with a Static IP enabled? 2) Would getting the Static IP add-on make the FX4100 usable for Xbox? 

Basically, I'm trying to figure out if I should keep the FX4100 or stick with the new G4AR to move forward. My next call to T-Mobile will be to enable the Static IP add-on, so I want to know which gateway I should tell them to provision it for.

Finally, I'd love to hear from anyone who has a working Open NAT setup on Xbox with either the FX4100 or the G4AR with or without the T-Mobile Static IP add-on. Any information on which gateway is more stable or easier to set up for this specific gaming purpose would be hugely helpful.

My ping/latency has gotten way worse for gaming, even though speeds technically went up a bit.

On my old Sagemcom gateway (same spot, same setup, wired connection), I used to sit around 25 ms ping on Xbox/PS5, maybe 35 ms during peak hours. Now with the G4, I’m lucky to stay under 80 ms — and that’s wired in, not Wi-Fi.

I even tried switching to 5 GHz Wi-Fi just to test, but it didn’t make any difference. What’s even stranger is that speed tests look totally fine — I’m still mid-20s ping on Speedtest and Fast.com, and speeds are maybe 10% faster overall. But in-game latency on Xbox and PS5 is way higher and less stable.

We are having some issues with one of our customers who has G4AR or G4SE (not sure which exactly, but will be able to find out for sure on Monday when I am back on site). 

This property is a large farm with 4 main buildings, one being the house where the gateway is located. 

The setup is Gateway to core switch (1ft away via cat 6), with a camera system NVR and one WAP coming off of that switch via cat 6, and fiber out of that switch connecting to the first out building. 

 2 WAPs in first out building, and fiber connected to second out building. 2 WAPs in that building, and a wireless bridge to the last building. 

The switches, bridges, and WAPs are equipment that we use on almost all jobs and are very familiar with. 

Customer had service from a wISP previous to us installing our system, but had a lightning strike and switched to Tmobile right before we came in. 

They seemed to have good luck with the service when they first got it, which was them just connecting a couple tvs and ipads wirelessly to the gateway which was placed by a window in the kitchen.

When we came to install our system, we had to move the gateway to a back room where the head end is located. Reception wasn't as good there, so customer went to Tmobile to get an external antenna. They told him they didn't have them, but told him one to order from Amazon so he did and we came out to install it. I don't have the model of it right now, but this thing looks like a white light saber and is like 4ft long. We installed it on the outside of the house and ran wires to the gateway. 

Figured everything was good to go, but a couple days later, he says his internet is dropping out. 

I go back out, and after messing around a little in the gateway settings on the front panel, see that you actually have to set it to external antenna. So I do, and the signal goes from ""good"" to ""excellent"". 

I go all over the property doing speedtests on my phone and and getting 200-600 down. All devices working as they should. 

Get 20 minutes down the road, he calls and says nothing is working. Turn around, by the time I get there, everything is working again. 

I log into the app from my phone and am able to see the limited settings available, so they aren't much help to me. 

Customer calls Tmob tech support, and they say that with a network like we have set up, that we probably need the Inseego FX4100 gateway, and that the external antenna for that gateway is different.

I would hate to have the customer order that and a different antenna, and get it all replaced, and find out that we have the same issue. 

Is there any insight anyone would have from the info I provided here? We don't have much experience with the Tmobile internet, as most of our customers have fiber ISP available, but this customer does not.

Has anyone else using a x75 modem started to see strange things happening when you are using say a IPv4 only connection to the  Chestertech 5G gateway such as a UDM Pro router, when using your T-Mobile Sim from their 5G modem?

I can instakill my Chestertech just by going to GrubHub in a browser or using the app on the phone.  All my 5G aggregated connections drop and a new connection is established but no IP address is registered from T-Mobile.   I put the Chestertech on my bench with a laptop that has the IPv6 stack disabled and connected it to the Chestertech with the x75.  The modem connected to the 5G-SA with no issue and had two n71 and n41 aggregated.  Browsed to GrubHub and bam connections lost and nothing reestablished properly. 

I then pulled out my T-Mobile G4AR and connected to the same PC after it connected and browed to GrubHub and it loaded just fine.

I can't make head or tails out of why this would be happening.  I nailed my DNS to [1.1.1.1](http://1.1.1.1) to see if it was a DNS issue and still the same results.  The Chestertech disconnects while the T-Mobile G4AR works fine.

Any ideas on where to go next with this?  I also found that sites that use heavy CDN content like Home Depot and Kohl's can cause the same issue.  I can't have a random user browsing bring down the internet.",7,8,0.051,0.92,0.029,-0.6136

Navigating T-mobile's customer service to actually get the gateway was it's own adventure (30 minute hold time, disconnected during transfer to ""the people that can help me"" because ""our office is closed"", another 30 minute hold the next day, transfer, hold) but eventually it's taken care of and the new gateway arrived today.

I removed the old one, pulled the sim card. Connected the new one using the sim from the old one. 

It powers up and shows a QR code to continue setup. That takes me to the app where it asks for the address. Put it in and all I get is a screen with ""See available plans"". OK, I'll bite. It churns away for a few moments and then comes back to tell me ""T-Mobile Home Internet is not yet available at your address"".

Hmmm, interesting, open CMD, ping and I'm connected. Run speedtest, great response, much faster than the old one.

I'm proficient with tech and I know they are probably at capacity, hence the ""not available"" message and by using the old sim they just see an existing customer. That would be so confusing for someone that's not good with tech. That would mean another hour trying to reach the right person at customer service.

tmobileisp,post,1o7gwud,2025-10-15 12:10:11,"T-Mobile wrecked my laptop So i just switched phone services to t-mobile and I opted in for their internet home wifi service. I still have most devices hooked up to my old/current isp, spectrum. I took my laptop out, an 4 year old HP, and tried to connect to the tmobile router, I got as far as entering the password for the router and the laptop freezes. After 30 seconds or so I get a blue screen, ""Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart, were just collecting some info..."" So it does that then starts an update, only then does it restart. I start it back up and it's now taking substantially longer to bood, windows icons are showing just the name with no picture/icon. After about 5 minutes for what takes usually 20-40 seconds I figure, drivers update or something, it didn't ask to download anything and there's nothing in my recent files. So I try to connect to this router again and the EXACT same thing happens. No update this time but the same error message etc. I boot up once more, log onto my spectrum internet and decide to open the one thing this laptop ever really gets used for, roblox. My kid plays Roblox on it or minecraft. I pull up Roblox, enter into a game, her most recent being 99 nights, and when it boots there are some serious issues. Textures are missing, the map is missing, item invintory has no items showing, equipping a tool shows the avatar whip out, nothing. Animation for holding the tool is showing but no tool. She literally played this thing hours ago. Somethings seriously wrong and I can't understand why connecting to a T-mobile router would have anything to do with this issue.

So what do I do? I have another laptop, also HP, a year older than this one, same OS, windows 10, basically everything the same, home icons are somewhat different but that's it. I try to log into the tmobile router and the same thing happens on that. Freezes up, then error message then starts an update,I shut it down mid update, pulled the power cord and I had taken out the battery so that I COULD power down if the same thing happened.

SO! does anyone know why this router from tmobile is wrecking my laptops? Our phones connected just fine, of course the tmobile phones work with the tmobile internet service, but I dont want to hook up my xbox s or ps5 if there is something malicious which, for the life of me I can't see how it's even possible. No permissions were asked or given, just the error and then immediate attempt to install updates.



Update: So after calling Tsupport, slogging through an hour or so of multiple holds, multiple people, several transfers and one call back I spoke to someone presumably in their IT. His first suggestion as well as almost everyone I spoke to was to update the drivers. Obviously that was the first thing I looked at since...well duh. T-mobile is a nationwide network and I have two 4 and 5 year old laptops that windows literally messaged me to say theres no support for any more. For windows 10 that is. It's a realtek wifi adapter, Hp often uses intel despite saying realtek but if you download GPU-Z or use the chris titus tool you can find out accurate system specs pretty quickly. Anyway just going into the device manager and right clicking your way to your drivers you can find if there are any available updates for your drivers. Which is what I did, of course since I'm running windows 10 an auto update and features like that are no longer supported. So hp website, realtek blah blah blah, drivers were supposedly current and up to date. This all did I know before I called TMCS and even had the info available for the tech on the phone. It was then that he got real with me, so it seemed I mean, you have to believe 99% of people are 99% full of crap but he told me based on the info I gave him for both my laptops and the current gen tmobile modem and seperate router (its not an all in one) that it might be the wi-fi bands switching too much or too often between the 2.4 and 5GHz and that while its not unique to tmobile it is often a problem for people running older laptops.

 I later googled this and found that while it isnt unique to to tmobile it IS a problem that occurs far more often on cellular networks as thats just how theyre set up. Phones often nessicitate switching towers and bands often as the phone usually moves with the person who owns it. Contemporary cable companies dont suffer from this as often since cable networks literally ran on cables 25 years ago so modems and the companies routers are capable of switching they just arent designed or programmed with the idea that a persons home internet will be moving its physical location often and having to connect to different towers or underground infrastructure. Unless you maybe live in tornado alley. Or florida cuz floridas crazy anyway.

  ANNNNNYYYywaaazzzz all that is to say, Thats likely the reason I only had this problem when connecting to tmobile and hadnt had it at all with spectrum. He told me this issue could be solved by accessing the tmobile gateway via the app (because of course you should download their app from google play so you can both easily access and customize your internet ads ads ads....ahem. I mean settings. It's for the settings and certainly not just another way for them to spam ads onto your eyeball socket holes) and creating two different SSIDs, one for each band. However once I downloaded the app and did so guess what? there already was two ssids. thats okay tho, I just told the router which one I ""prefferred and bobs your uncle, the problem was probably fixed! Maybe. Possibly? Naw. I tried to connect with the newer of the two laptops and what happened? I got online! amazing, all was well in the world and my daughter could now- oh nope. Laptop froze and restarted.  So idk. Maybe the damage was done. Maybe its still an existing problem. Ima run through the same deal with the other laptop and see what I can see, might even try to install win11 on that one. Or a completely different OS altogether? I've been meaning to do that to force myself into learning Linux so I'm not so dependent on whatever the corporations are rolling out just because we don't have a better choice that doesnt require any work on our part.  It's crazy how much work we humans will do to avoid doing something we think is work. 

OMG whatever happened to this laptop when I tried to connect to that router...this thing is screwed up. You know the red underline for misspelled words? (I'm on chrome) when I right click the word and click on the correct spelling to change it, the entire wall of text refreshes. All the lines disappear, it changes the one word I misspelled and then all the red lines reappear. And I misspelled A LOT. Despite learning a whole lot about SSIDs the differences between 2.4 and 5GHz what year time warner actually changed to Spectrum and how not all modems are created equal even when it comes down to certain pc brands running better with certain modems due to compatable hardware I have only a superficial understanding of PCs. So I really have no idea how this thing got so fragged but I am now 100% certain it was simple oversight or just laziness on tmobiles part. ",0,30,0.077,0.878,0.045,-0.9897

Long version:

I took T-Mobile up on the upgrade offer and ordered a new gateway.  It would be easier for me to return my old gateway at a T-Mobile store, which I've read other folks have done.  However, the rep processing my order wasn't sure if that is possible.

Today I received the new gateway, but the box it came with is too small to fit the Nokia trashcan gateway.  And to make matters worst, part of the the return label somehow got stuck to the inside of the box and part of the QR code got ripped while I was peeling it off.

I called T-Mobile about this, they told to find any old box and to make sure the gateway doesn't move around in it too much.  (Where would I find a box like that?)  As for the label, they can't email me another one for some reason, I would have to go to a T-Mobile store and ask them to print one out for me.  I asked this rep about returning it to the store, and he says since this was processed online, I would have to mail it back.

Later in the day I stopped by a T-Mobile store to get a new return label printed, the rep at the store told me to forget about the label and just bring in the gateway.  He said they can accept the return and print a receipt for me.  I told him the 2nd rep told me about having to mail it back, he just said I'll have the receipt to prove that it's returned.

So the question is, can I just return the gateway to the T-Mobile store?  The non-return fee is $375, I'm afraid they'll say I didn't return it correctly and charge me.

After digging into the metrics, I realized the new gateway only locks onto 5G Standalone (SA) and has no LTE anchor. My older unit connected in 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) mode (5G + LTE together), and that combo gave me much more stable speeds and better SINR, even though the raw 5G wasn’t as strong.

Every time I called, there was this sound in the background, just this little tap, tap, tap at varying volume. I thought it was something in their apartment at first, but when I asked, they said their side was completely silent. We went back and forth on it. I heard it. They didn’t. It might’ve caused a little bickering.

The sound began to drive me nuts over time, like some psychological warfare type tactics. I switched to Discord just to escape it, and that worked, though the app drained my battery and data like it had a personal vendetta. Still, it was the only way to talk without that maddening rhythm in my ear. I called T-Mobile. They reset my network. He called AT&T. Same thing. The tapping stayed. He told me it must be my phone. I replaced it. The tapping stayed. I’m- 

Anyway, it started to feel like I was living in some twisted Edgar Allen Poe story. Tap. Tap. Tap. Always there, no matter what I did. Where’s the gd raven saying nevermore? Cmon now. 

Eventually, while just accepting that it was either discord or insanity, I had to call a coworker about a spreadsheet. We were mid-sentence when it happened again. That same sound. Tap. Tap. Tap. Holy hell. The work, the spreadsheet? Gone from my mind. She had an iPhone, and my partner had Android. Different phones, different states, different everything. Yet, the tapping. There could be only one answer left. 

I asked her, trying to sound casual, what network she used.
“AT&T,” she said, like it was nothing.

And suddenly, everything made sense. It wasn’t me, it wasn’t my phone, it wasn’t the apartment. It was something between T-Mobile and AT&T. Completely not on either of us, and the support specialists I’d called had just NOT BELIEVED ME. Seriously I’ve called like three times about it.

We also use the T-Mobile ""Life"" app to follow the ""cellular metrics"", with which we're only now becoming familiar.  Our signal band varies between n25 to n41, with download speeds @ 300+ Mbps for the former, and 500+ for the latter.  The values the app reports — also confirmed by the HINT app — show RSRQ = excellent, RSRP = poor, and SiNR = poor, where RSRQ @ -10, RSRP (-)95 - (-100), SiNR 5-15.

Now, subjectively, the picture quality streaming, e.g., live sports and other programming over YTTV has been first-class, as is subscription streaming (Peacock ) hosted by Roku, despite what appears to be mediocre to poor signal quality.

1. For those that use HINT Control or even T-Life for that matter, the options seem even more gimped to adjust things on the gateway vs the other gateways. For whatever reason the 5ghz frequency seems to always auto assign to the DFS, then there is no way to manually assign the channel or bandwidth on any of the frequencies. Has anyone found a way to adjust those particulars? Also, some of the metrics are missing for the G5AR, mainly channel bandwidth.



2. IP addressing on IPv6. In the past with any of the other gateways that I have used the IPv4 and IPv6 address location has always matched; Louisville, KY for me. Now the IPv4 is the same, but the IPv6 always comes back to Seattle, WA. Don't think it is a major issue, is anybody else with the G5AR noticing something similar?   [https://whatismyipaddress.com/](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)



3. Speeds are fairly consistent through the day, possibly the 8x8 MIMO keeping the signal better? Not the speeds I receive, but the consistency is what I am pointing out, YMMV as always. I do notice in the hours of about midnight to roughly 8-9AM speeds dip a smidge, could just be my rural area and how the network is managed. T-Mobile didn't have the foresight or belief in their network and stayed with 1GB ethernet ports. Not really an issue, but still.

A few questions:

Does anyone know if there are any valuable and functional differences between their current three plans? (""Rely"" vs ""Amplified"" vs ""All-in"")
I see that the Rely plan includes a ""5g gateway"" and the other two have ""High-performance premium 5G Gateway"". Does anyone know what that gateway typically is? We currently have the kvd21 - is it any better or worse than the new tmobile gateway? I'm confused that T-Mobile is differentiating the ""rely"" and the ""amplified"" based on the gateway, whereas the photos of the gateways appear the same.
I understand that they are throwing on services for the ""All-in"", including a mesh AP. I'm not super interested, our household isn't particularly large.

Speed tests are with [speedtest.com](http://speedtest.com) and Google speed test.  
The numbers represent how the cords would go into the ports on your Gateway from 1 to 4. For example, 1234 means 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4.  1324 would mean 1-1, 2-3, 3-2, 4-4.

Admittedly, our modem isn't placed optimally (it's just in a convenient spot, not nearby windows or angled to towers), but neither was our old modem and that performed significantly better.

I want to know if there's any feasable way for me to boost the signal and/or improve reliability.... such as requesting a different Gateway model, upgrading the plan, getting some kind of accessory add-on, or calling T-Mobile will help at all, or if I'm just shit out of luck and stuck with this the way it is.

I bought a fx4100 off of ebay but couldn't get it to work on tmobile home internet and when I talked with customer service they kinda wanted to slap my wrist for getting a device from a non approved tmobile reseller.

Told them I wanted to go to WiFi 7 and something newer because that's why I had bought the FX4100. They ended up hooking me with a G5AR and started running speedtests. I'm consistently getting around 1200 Mbps!

There are two n41 carriers, one is 100 MHz wide and roughly 2.5 - 2.6 GHz, the second is 90 MHz wide and roughly 2.6 - 2.7 GHz. The 90 MHz one is especially bad with upload <1 Mbps and often >90% packet loss. The Spitz allows me to lock out n41 and rely on n25, which has worked pretty well. I also got cables and put the antennas that came with the Spitz in the attic while the gateway itself is in a climate controlled area of the house. I get 150 - 250 Mbps down and 35 Mbps up in this configuration.

  
I've toyed with getting a panel antenna but didn't want to pay Waveform prices. I found this ""WiFiX Blaster 2x2"" antenna on WirelessHaven and Amazon for $70 so I decided to try it out. And since I cannot find any reviews of it online I thought I'd post here. I replaced two of the Spitz included antennas with this, while leaving the 2nd pair as they were in the attic. I also haven't done any optimization of position. Just installed it and went back downstairs to turn the gateway on to see how it would work.

  
Before my n25 RSRP was about -90 dBm. The new antenna hasn't changed that at all, and hasn't changed my n25 speeds at all either.

However, for n41 it's been a game changer. RSRP improved from -105 to -90, and my upload speeds have improved from <1 Mbps on the 90 MHz n41 carrier to about 15 Mbps, and packet loss has dropped from 90% to 0%.

I signed up for TMHI online, and they sent me a G5SE. I had troubles with this modem. If I connected to the wifi, I got 980 down. If I connected to the wired ports, I got 250 max. It was odd. I had this issue through my firewall, a test switch, a computer, you name it. Replaced cables, all that.

I traded it in for the sagecom, and the sagecom would only get 350 down, both wired and wireless

I then went back to the store, got the G5AR, and this one is getting me 450 down both wired and wireless, but I KNOW my tower can do 980+, because I can get those speeds with my cellphone, and the original G5SE Was able to get those speeds... What gives? Any ideas?

I have had TMHI at my address before and it was very sporadic and would require a reboot of the modem at least a few times a week because of dropped connections. However, it was probably the fastest service 400+mbps with the lowest ping I have ever been able to get at my rural location. Due to the inconsistency of the connection I opted to not keep the service.

I currently have US Cellular's home internet service. It's is a very consistent solid connection but it has slow download speeds of about 25/30mbps. They also implement a data cap of 600GBb each month and throttle heavily after going over. 

I'd be happy with the data cap removal, but access to that T-Mobile speed wouldn't make me sad. 

 Hardware Side-Note:  I feel like the outdoor antenna style setup from USC with the Eero as a router is a much better solution than the all-in-one gateway solution T-Mobile uses. The Casa receivers they use are nice as well, you could see advanced cellular metricsand have manual network selection that you can't get with T-Mobile without using 3rd party gateways.

Also, which number is most important to lower ping time?  I get enough speed on both T/R but want to find a spot that can give me the best ping time, even if I need to sacrifice some speed (to a point).

Adding to context, I used to have a G4AR and ping time was normally between 25ms to 35ms.

So, I have the HINT app, but I don't really know what any of it means. I don't think my setup would be a candidate because I'm getting excellent reception.

As an aside, the phone and modem, came a few days later. When trying to set up the modem T-Mobile shows it has not shipped yet. It appears another phone and modem are on the way.

I have Amplified 5G home internet and the T4SE router.  
I have noticed that pretty consistently, if I go several days without unplugging / plugging back in the router, it will reach a point where my speed goes down noticeably.

I realize that will force the connection to renegotiate as well as flush out any volatile memory in the unit.  
But I am curious what is physically happening.  
Like is it something Tmobile does intentionally or something else?

The only thing being rebooted here is the router.  
My PC gets warm or cold booted once in a while but that has no bearing on what I'm talking about.  
My PC gets disconnected manually from the wifi any time I'm not using it.  
Also, I am aware my internet speed fluctuates some throughout the day depending on how heavy tower traffic is and other factors.  But I'm not talking about that either.  
When the problem occurs, it is always an immediate major bump in speed comparing before and after power cycling the router.

EDIT: At my house the signal is weak so I don't get full 5G speed but I typically see download speed in the 30-60 Mbps range.  
As a current example, this morning I was getting consistent speed tests before  power cycling the router of 1.5-2.5.    Two speed tests after power cycling the router were 37 and 74 Mbps",6,18,0.043,0.896,0.061,0.6072

tmobileisp,post,1n2rv9v,2025-08-28 18:36:19,"G5AR External Antennas Hi everyone,

We’ve been following all the G5AR threads, and we’re just as puzzled as you are about why T-Mobile removed the antenna ports. 

The G5AR uses an 8x8 antenna internally for the first time, and adding eight external ports is a little trickier than four - but the device certainly benefits from an outdoor antenna just as much as previous devices.

We put together a step-by-step guide on how to open and modify the G5AR to connect external antennas:

[https://www.waveform.com/a/b/guides/hotspots/t-mobile-5g-gateway-g5ar](https://www.waveform.com/a/b/guides/hotspots/t-mobile-5g-gateway-g5ar)

At first we expected it to be much tougher to modify than past models, but it’s about on par with the older “trashcan” gateways. Not trivial, but definitely doable. Because the G5AR runs true 8x8 receive on n41 and n77, you’ll want an 8x8 antenna setup. For now we recommend using two 4x4 antennas while we finish work on a dedicated 8x8 option.

We’ve also added port-by-port tech specs at the end of the guide. That’s useful if you want to experiment with port order or try connecting just four ports, though that’s not something we’ve tested yet.

One important note: T-Mobile has been pretty clear that they may charge a fee if you return a modified device. We don’t want to discourage tinkering, but we do want to be upfront - be careful making any changes.

I’ll hang out in the comments the next few days - happy to answer any questions.",44,24,0.034,0.793,0.173,0.9882

This past week has been a nightmare though. My internet became practically unusable. Speedtest by Ookla reports speeds all over the place. The best I have hit was 180/5 but only momentarily because for the most part it's somewhere closer to 50/1.5 and there has been times where I hit 10/0.5.

Customer/technical service are clueless. They keep telling me that there's maintenance work they do at the tower I was connecting to up until recently, but neither they gave me a heads up about those service disruptions, nor do they give me an ETA of completion, not even promise to notify me when this will be completed to at least know what kind of situation I am in at that point. The last person I spoke to today said ""at this point I want to wish you to enjoy the rest of your summer"" LOL.

They did offer me some credit for this month's bill but that's totally useless if you don't have internet service practically speaking.

The next morning (today) I received the tracking information & contacted T-Mobile so they can call UPS.

Well, a few hours later, I received a notification stating that UPS has the package so I called back AGAIN to get further assistance.

I just pre-ordered fiber through tmobile.. I'm in a new metronet service area so who knows when the install will actually happen.  I'm in no rush.

I am wondering where they might enter the house and what influence I have. 

I'm on a corner lot. Along the long side of the property, along the street, metronet put in two large boxes. There is also ""flowerpot"" in my neighbors back yard. A metronet salesman told me they could probably come from any one of those. He wasn't sure why I had two in my side yard, but that's a different discussion.

I would prefer if they would come in from one of the large boxes along the street, into the side of my house because it would be more or less a straight shot into where my network rack is and all my other equipment, in the unfinished part of the basement. 

If they have to come in from the back of the house, much like coax comes now, there is a cat5e-looking cable that runs from the same box that the coax is in on the house to my network rack, where everything else is home run.  I think that could be an option two, even though that cable comes out inside that box, it's my cable.. I wonder if there would be a way to utilize that.

In any situation, I need to get the service close to my network setup.. 

Anyone have any experience with installation on a corner lot, with seemingly multiple ways to get service to the house?  I realize that some of it is likely to be the luck of the draw to if I get a tech that gives a crap or not. :) If I can't get it to where I want, I may just forgo the service and stick with coax for now. 🤷

Basically discussing the Elsys x62 PoE setup and suggesting in a roundabout way that Elsys is likely skipping the x75 chipset and waiting/starting the certification process for x85 which has been announced already. I tried the Suncomm 08 Ultra with x75 and found no real benefit in speeds or CA, and in fact some drawbacks in terms of stability vs my G4AR, my Peplink Br1 Pro 5g (x62) or even iPhone 16 pro on x71 chip. This might explain why x75 upgrades have been sparse in the consumer router market lately. 

  
Snapdragon X75 vs. X65

* **Downlink throughput**: \~10 Gbps (same as X65) → **no improvement** (minor).
* **Uplink throughput**: \~3.0–3.5 Gbps vs. \~3.0 Gbps on X65 → **\~10% improvement** (minor).
* **Carrier aggregation (sub-6 GHz)**: similar to X65 at 4x, with modest tuning → **minor**.
* **mmWave aggregation**: up to 10-carrier vs. 8-carrier on X65 → **\~25% improvement** for mmWave-heavy networks (major, but niche in U.S.).
* **Power efficiency**: \~20% better vs. X65 → **major** in handsets, **minor** in routers with fixed power.
* **AI-based signal management**: new dedicated AI accelerator → **major** in edge cases (better handoff, beam management).
* **5G Advanced readiness**: first R18-capable modem → **major** in terms of feature alignment, but networks not yet there in 2025.

# 🔹 Snapdragon X85 vs. X65

* **Downlink throughput**: 12.5 Gbps vs. 10 Gbps → **\~25% improvement** (major).
* **Uplink throughput**: 3.7 Gbps vs. 3.0 Gbps → **\~20–25% improvement** (major).
* **Carrier aggregation (sub-6 GHz)**: 6x vs. 4x → **\~50% increase in aggregated spectrum** (major, very impactful for AT&T/T-Mobile).
* **Low-latency scheduling**: improved TTI granularity → **major** for jitter-sensitive apps.
* **Adaptive energy/performance balancing**: AI-driven management of power, thermal load, and throughput → **major** for sustained router performance.
* **Power efficiency**: 30–40% better vs. X65 → **major** for mobile, moderate benefit in routers.
* **5G Advanced R18 features**: broader support, including uplink slicing, enhanced reliability, and NTN (satellite) hooks → **major future-proofing**.

**Summary:**

* **X75 over X65** = incremental (mostly efficiency, mmWave, AI refinement).
* **X85 over X65** = transformative (higher throughput, much better uplink, more CA, lower latency, AI-driven balancing, future-proof features).

However, in speed tests in 4G coverage, upload speeds doesn't exceed 15 Mbps in the best conditions while standing literally next to the cellular tower. And in some extremely rare situations, It reaches 30 Mbps. Although download speed is usually around 120+ Mbps.

  
And in 5G coverage, download speed is around 650Mbps+ in the best situations and 170Mbps+ in the poor normal situations, but upload speed doesn't exceed 25 Mbps in the best situations, haven't even had the ""extremely rare situations"" like the one mentioned above in the 4G.

What I have tried,

Tried doing Network resets from the phone.

Tried changing SIMs for different providers and didn't work \[ However, one of the providers had nice upload speeds 40Mbps+ in 4G for example, but with no 5G coverage and extremely high ping and bufferbloated all the time \]

Tried changing servers, results are almost the same even for out borders servers.  
Tried calling the SIM provider, and they said the routine stuff about doing network resets, etc... \[ wasn't helpful \]

What really helped was putting the SIM back into my Samsung A52 phone  
But that phone is a 4G+ phone not a 5G phone. and also download speeds were much lower.

Thanks in advance.
